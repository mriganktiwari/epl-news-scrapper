Wolves went into half-time with a lead that they looked unlikely to fritter away. But there has been an unusual brittleness to Nuno\u2019s side this season.", "West Brom equalised soon after the restart by exploiting Wolves\u2019 weakness from set pieces, Bartley out-jumping R\u00faben Neves to flick on a long throw-in by Dara O\u2019Shea before Ajayi sent a looping header into the net. Four minutes later Wolves were guilty of more slackness in their box, Conor Coady clipping Robinson\u2019s heel to concede another penalty.

A Riyad Mahrez diagonal was turned back from the left post towards Foden but Joel Veltman cleared the danger.

When Digne laid the ball first-time back to Iwobi, the midfielder guided it expertly into the net from 15 yards.", "Now it was Wolves\u2019 turn to show how they could improvise without key attackers. That is a familiar challenge for a side who have won only one of eight league matches since losing Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez to a fractured skull. With Adama Traor\u00e9 and Daniel Podence also missing, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo elected to deploy Morgan Gibbs-White as a deep-lying centre-forward while F\u00e1bio Silva started on the left.

That buoyed Wolves, who nearly took the lead four minutes later when Pedro Neto teed up Silva, whose shot from 12 yards was blocked by Jordan Pickford.", "Soon Rui Patr\u00edcio had to deny Iwobi at the other end following a nifty one-two with Rodr\u00edguez. Both sides, cleverly drilled to be fluid, glowed with ambition in a fast-paced and entertaining opening. But as the game progressed, each team betrayed understandable bluntness. When Digne delivered a sumptuous cross from the left into prime poaching territory in the 45th minute, no forward anticipated it.", "Wolves\u2019 slickness tended to evaporate when they reached the box, because of Everton\u2019s solidity and their own lack of power and nous up front.

The towering frame of Dan Burn was all over him but against such a blistering operator, the defender was always in danger of being spun.

At least that reflects one positive aspect of Villa\u2019s display, the fact that they remained a coherent and mostly dominant team despite having to make wholesale changes to their starting lineup for the first time this season owing to the suspensions of Douglas Luiz and Matty Cash and illness for Ezri Konsa, along with injury to Ross Barkley. \u201cOur squad was tested today and it passed with flying colours, so that\u2019s a positive I can take,\u201d said Smith.", "Burnley, emboldened for an even bigger challenge after last weekend\u2019s win at Arsenal, made it hard for the hosts to settle. Sean Dyche\u2019s team were the first to threaten a goal, with Jay Rodriguez cutting a smart pass back to Ashley Westwood, whose shot from the edge of the area veered just wide. Villa, devoted to attack, soon found a rhythm, and Charlie Taylor had to make a critical intervention in the 21st minute when he slid in to block an effort from six yards by Bertrand Traor\u00e9, who should have shot sooner.", "Burnley were rescued by their other full-back on the half hour when Matt Lowton showed wily instincts to position himself on the goalline in time to head away a deflected shot by Ahmed Elmohamady.", "Villa mounted something close to an onslaught after that and struck the frame of the goal twice before the break. Anwar El Ghazi\u2019s free-kick from 20 yards was actually heading into the net until Pope tipped it on to the crossbar. Just before half-time Elmohamady flicked on a corner by Traor\u00e9 to Kortney Hause, whose reflex header from six yards bounced out off the post.", "Although Villa merited a half-time lead on the balance of play, Burnley had alarmed them on a couple of counterattacks. The saves that Mart\u00ednez had to make from Robbie Brady and Chris Wood were elementary but the goalkeeper would surely have been tested more stringently by Dwight McNeil just before the break if Traor\u00e9 had not charged back to make an excellent tackle on the midfielder, who had slalomed between two defenders on a counter-attack.", "For all Villa\u2019s attacking, their centre-forward Ollie Watkins got little sight of goal in the first half, spending most of his time as a clever linkman or decoy. But as Villa\u2019s hold on the game grew stronger, Watkins began to find himself in front of goal more often. Pope remained unbeatable, however, clutching the striker\u2019s header to his chest early in the second half. One minute later Watkins turned provider again, teeing up El Ghazi for a drive that flew inches past the post from the edge of the box.", "El Ghazi, involved in most Villa attacks, curled a low effort at goal on the hour, but not with enough power to inconvenience Pope. The same could be said of Brady\u2019s shot at the other end moments later, when Burnley made a rare second-half incursion into Villa territory.", "When Jack Grealish, deployed more centrally than usual but as enterprising as ever, glided through midfield in the 66th minute and slipped through a delicate invitation to El Ghazi to score, yet another weak shot ensued, much to Pope\u2019s relief. El Ghazi created a chance for himself to make amends in the 75th minute but boomed a shot wide from 20 yards after a splendid burst from midfield.", "The element of surprise nearly did for Burnley when John McGinn caught them out with a quickly-taken free-kick in midfield but James Tarkowski rushed to the visitors\u2019 rescue again, hurling himself in front of Traor\u00e9\u2019s shot.", "Villa attacked until the end but could not find the perfect finish, Tyrone Mings heading wide from eight yards before Grealish blasted over the bar after another classy run from deep."], "datePublished": "Thu 17 Dec 2020 20.14\u00a0GMT"}, "_Leicester City_Chelsea": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/19/leicester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report", "Home team": "Leicester City", "Away team": "Chelsea", "Title": "Leicester go top of Premier League after Ndidi and Maddison cut down Chelsea", "Body": ["Leicester are top of the league and worthy title contenders.

Marc Albrighton played a short corner to Maddison and then accepted the return pass before pulling the ball back to Harvey Barnes near the penalty spot. Barnes, whose gorgeous cross had led to the corner, swished at the air, a mis-hit that turned into the perfect tee-up for Ndidi, who struck a superb left-footed shot in off the post from 20 yards.

Leicester, content to counterattack, tore a gaping hole in their defence again in the 50th minute, but James Justin headed wide from Albrighton\u2019s cross. Five minutes later Maddison prised them apart again with an exquisite pass, but Leicester sabotaged their own brilliant move by straying offside. But soon the hosts picked their way forward again, Maddison conspiring artfully with Vardy before forcing a good save from Mendy.", "With his team drifting to defeat, Lampard finally reached for a different plan in the 67th minute. On came Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech for Hudson-Odoi and Havertz.

Neither could be faulted for endeavour and there was plenty to admire about their structures off the ball; none of that was enough to set pulses racing and the major frustration was felt by those in home colours.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a disappointed dressing room, we feel it was two points lost,\u201d said Stuart Gray, the Fulham assistant manager, who took remote orders from the self-isolating Parker throughout the 90 minutes. \u201cYou can tell by [Southampton\u2019s] reaction that they\u2019re happy with the point. We got into some very good areas and our final ball just let us down.\u201d", "He was right about Fulham\u2019s inability to make promising positions count. They worked the ball wide smartly enough but tended to fall short through a mixture of inadequate delivery and an absence of focal point. When both were in sync, 10 minutes after half-time, the impressive Antonee Robinson crossed deliciously from the left only for an unmarked Ivan Cavaleiro to head over.", "That was their best opportunity, although Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa had air-kicked when found by Ademola Lookman during an opening spell that promised more. They threatened again towards the end, when the substitute Aleksandar Mitrovic volleyed wide after more fine work from Robinson and Ola Aina had an effort blocked, but the sum of their efforts was not really enough given Southampton never really got going.", "\u201cIt was the most important thing first to have a clean sheet,\u201d said Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, who confirmed Gray\u2019s view by adding that he could \u201clive with a point\u201d. That was largely because his list of absentees included Danny Ings, Oriol Romeu and Jannik Vestergaard, meaning the spine of Southampton\u2019s side was decimated. Shane Long and Ibrahima Diallo had to make their first top-flight starts of the season and there was a recall for Jack Stephens at the back. They looked disjointed, their ambition noticeably a notch below usual levels, although they came closest to scoring a winner and returning to the top four.", "James Ward-Prowse\u2019s brilliance from set pieces was a constant amid the flux and, although Darren England looked happy to play the advantage after a foul by Harrison Reed before the half-hour, the midfielder had eyes for one thing only.", "His free-kick from 25 yards was among the best of a sparkling collection, aimed plum into Alphonse Areola\u2019s top-right corner, and that made the outcome all the more astonishing. Areola somehow managed to claw the ball on to the angle of post and bar, Che Adams somehow failing to connect with the rebound as it bounced down. In a split-second Fulham had been blessed by a save-of-the-season contender and a glaring miss.", "\u201cWe had the bigger chances,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said, pointing to disallowed second-half efforts from Long and Theo Walcott.

Anyone asking that question, and there were one or two, would be doing a disservice to the rare vision and imagination he offers a side that does not always brim with those qualities.

Forced to defend against a talented side who enjoyed hearty backing from a noisy home crowd, Manchester City found their resolve and dug in to earn an ugly win on the road, finding a way to acknowledge Sam Allardyce\u2019s return to Premier League management by battling hard to emerge from a frantic encounter with three crucial points.", "It will not go down as one of the great displays from a Guardiola side. While there were moments of class from Kevin De Bruyne, who created Raheem Sterling\u2019s winner, it was more brawn than beauty from City. They rarely left themselves exposed at the back and understood the result mattered more than the performance, grafting to a victory that lifts them out of the mid-table thicket, eight points off the leaders, Liverpool.", "For Guardiola, satisfaction came from another disciplined away performance. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Rodri were controlled in midfield and the resurgence of John Stones continued in central defence, ensuring Southampton created little.", "It was a collective effort and although City remain below their exhilarating best, it would be folly to count them out of the title running just yet, especially if their improvement without the ball helps their mojo in attack return.", "Given City also lacked ambition when they held Manchester United at Old Trafford, the restraint feels deliberate from Guardiola. Unable to trust his forwards, he needs to lay down solid foundations. Under pressure to show the champion mettle of old has not completely disappeared, Guardiola needed City to rise to the challenge of containing Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s hard-running side, who immediately tried to seize the initiative, insistent pressing from James Ward-Prowse and Oriol Romeu setting the tone in midfield.", "During the early stages it seemed City were remembering the best of the Guardiola way, hoarding possession and outnumbering their opponents in the middle, with De Bruyne menacing in the No 10 role.", "The breakthrough came from that midfield supremacy. When Jan Bednarek failed to get enough distance on a clearing header, the Southampton spine vanished. The ball dropped to De Bruyne in acres of space, spelling danger. The Belgian advanced, exchanged passes with Bernardo Silva on the right and produced a clever cut back for Sterling to sweep a shot past Alex McCarthy.", "As City\u2019s star has waned, so has Sterling\u2019s. Strangely muted in recent months, uncertainty has crept into his game. He had looked hesitant before finding the net with a crisp finish, failing to beat Kyle Walker-Peters when he had opportunities to test Southampton\u2019s right-back.", "In that context, it felt as though Sterling\u2019s eighth goal of the season might have wider significance: could it be the spark for City? When confidence has taken a few knocks, though, the level can drop quickly.", "\u201cWe could not control the game,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cOur momentum up front is not good. That\u2019s why I think we will continue to struggle this season.\u201d", "Southampton started to put City under pressure. Ederson saved well from Theo Walcott, who would also send in crosses for Che Adams and Danny Ings, neither of whom could direct their headers on target.", "It was tough for Stones and his partner, R\u00faben Dias. Yet Southampton lacked composure. Moussa Djenepo wanted too many touches on the left wing and Southampton suffered a blow when Ings went off injured. Nathan Tella, a 21-year-old striker, struggled after replacing Southampton\u2019s top-scorer. \u201cI think it\u2019s a hamstring problem,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said. \u201cI hope he stepped off early enough.\u201d", "The chances fell to City at the start of the second half. Playing without a conventional forward, the visitors were slippery at times. Ferran Torres fired an angled shot wide. Silva moved into the middle, rotating with Torres, and looked certain to score after more excellence from De Bruyne, only to scuff straight at McCarthy.", "In need of a spark, Southampton brought Nathan Redmond on for Djenepo. Moments later Ward-Prowse almost caught Ederson out with one of his devilish corners, while City escaped when Sterling appeared to handle in the area.", "Southampton, though, ran out of ideas. With Stones producing another commanding display, City were comfortable in the end, even though Riyad Mahrez wasted chances after coming off the bench.", "Guardiola called it an \u201cincredible, important victory\u201d.

It does not seem so long ago that they were mired in that gruesome slump, unable to buy a victory or even, seemingly, a goal.", "The statistics showed they had scored just four in 10 Premier League games up to the defeat at Everton on 19 December but at kick-off here they could reflect on eight in the previous three \u2013 all of them victories.", "Arsenal being Arsenal, they duly punctured the mood of cautious optimism by playing out a scoreless draw and, amid plunging temperatures, the truth was that it could have been worse for them.", "Crystal Palace hit the crossbar through the defender James Tomkins, and if Christian Benteke in particular had been able to locate a cutting edge in front of goal, the visitors would have had more fulsome reward for a performance of energy, discipline and no little thrust.", "It was difficult to remember Arsenal extending the Palace goalkeeper, Vicente Guaita, and their frustrations were summed up in the 84th minute when they tried to counter through the substitute, Eddie Nketiah, only for him to be fouled by Joel Ward.", "The incident happened directly in front of Mikel Arteta and, when the ball spun clear, the Arsenal manager edged on to the field to swipe at it and the nearby Andros Townsend. There was contact between him and Townsend \u2013 as we are obliged to say these days \u2013 and Arteta was perhaps fortunate that the Palace winger wore a broad smile instead of a scowl and did not seek to make anything of it.", "Roy Hodgson, the Palace manager, said he hoped that the performance would do a lot for the confidence of his players moving forward and there was a sense of adventure about his 4-4-2 formation, in which Wilfried Zaha played in attack alongside Benteke. That said, Zaha\u2019s license to roam was pronounced and the forward was involved in many of his team\u2019s best sequences.", "Palace were bright in the first half and unlucky not to lead at the end of it. Eberechi Eze glided with intent off the left \u2013 what a lovely stride he has, matched by a composure in possession \u2013 while Benteke was effective and selfless with his link-up play.", "Arsenal dared not give Zaha too much space and his best moment of the first half came when he swapped passes with Benteke and sliced away from two Arsenal challenges inside the penalty area. He could not get away from a third, which was put in by Granit Xhaka. The Arsenal midfielder made a series of important one-on-one tackles and he was his team\u2019s best performer.", "It had to be said that there was not much competition. Emile Smith Rowe faded after a few flashes in the first half while there was little from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette or Bukayo Saka.", "Palace thought they had the lead on 39 minutes when Tomkins got above Rob Holding to meet an Eze free-kick only for his header to come back off the woodwork while, minutes later, Tyrick Mitchell crossed from the left for Benteke, whose header drew a flying save out of Bernd Leno. Palace could also point to the moment in the 29th minute when Mitchell cut the ball back and Benteke, leaning back, lifted wastefully high.", "Arsenal only quickened the pulses once before the break when Smith Rowe crossed low for Lacazette, having been released up the right by Xhaka. But with Lacazette shaping to shoot, H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn arrived to nudge the ball away from him and to nobody in particular.", "It was a good example of Arsenal\u2019s lack of cohesion. They got into some decent positions at times but the final action was routinely missing. Aubameyang cut in from the left and banged straight at Guaita, who parried up into the air before grabbing at the second attempt, while Saka shot tamely at the goalkeeper.", "Arsenal lacked spark \u2013 Arteta said it was a lack of freshness because of the number of matches they have played \u2013 and it was plain that they missed their in-form left-back, Kieran Tierney, who had to pull out at the last moment because of a tight calf. His withdrawal unhinged Arteta\u2019s plans. Tierney faces a scan on Friday.", "Arsenal began the second half at a higher tempo, with Beller\u00edn and Tierney\u2019s replacement, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, pressing high from the full-back positions. Both of them had sights of goal; Beller\u00edn\u2019s was the better chance, but he lashed wide.", "Arteta replaced Maitland-Niles with Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 \u2013 a switch that saw Saka go from right wing to left-back \u2013 and it was an illustration of the manager\u2019s determination to push for the win. But it also allowed Palace to flicker on the counter, with Xhaka cutting out one Zaha cross that was aimed for Benteke.

This came when the Frenchman won an initial flick-on, the ball went to Bruno Fernandes and he found Marcus Rashford along the right. The No 10 crossed and there was Pogba to smash in a volley that beat Nick Pope via a Matthew Lowton deflection.", "Victory means United go to 36 points and overtake Liverpool, with 33 \u2013 this having last been achieved after the same number of games when beating Sunderland 3-1 on 15 December 2012 under Sir Alex Ferguson.", "The upturn in United\u2019s fortunes under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is further underlined by the changed circumstances as they head to Anfield on Sunday: before last term\u2019s corresponding fixture United were 27 points behind.", "A delighted Solskj\u00e6r stated that meeting will be difficult and praised Pogba. \u201cHe is a good character in the dressing room, he is always the one the lads look to and he\u2019s a world champion of course. He\u2019s at his best at the moment,\u201d the manager said.", "Pogba said: \u201c I am always happy when I win and we are top [but] there is still a long way to go, there are big games coming up so we have to focus on that.\u201d", "This was a victory that rewarded unerring determination, a theme of United\u2019s season. Until Pogba\u2019s effervescence they struggled to find a telling rhythm despite dominating. Attacks faltered before being built and so the contest was stuck in the middle third: precisely where Burnley wanted it.", "When Fernandes, Nemanja Matic and Luke Shaw combined the latter released a cross from the left which Anthony Martial dummied and suddenly Fernandes had sight of goal. His shot went straight into the hands of Pope but this was better.", "As good was a move on the other side. This time Rashford tapped the ball to Fernandes and he chipped it behind Martial, whose overhead volley was again saved by Pope.", "Complacency appeared United\u2019s greatest threat. Fernandes fell prey to this when a heavy touch allowed Lowton to pickpocket him \u2013 Burnley swept forward but Chris Wood\u2019s attempt was blocked by Eric Bailly.", "A bitty contest next had two moments of VAR intrigue. Shaw challenged Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Fernandes took over, hitting a 40-yard pass into Edinson Cavani, who was felled by Robbie Brady as he approached the Burnley box. Kevin Friend, the referee, blew for a foul and issued Brady with a yellow card.", "VAR inspected both incidents, then instructed Friend to do the same at the pitchside monitor. He did so and decided to chalk off Brady\u2019s booking and instead issue Shaw with a yellow card for his tackle on Gudmundsson, the left-back taking his leg after the ball. United were upset, Burnley tried to race back downfield to take a quick free-kick but were not allowed to and, when finally executing it, failed to capitalise.", "There was further confusion when Harry Maguire, whose header beat Pope, had the \u201cgoal\u201d ruled out for pushing Erik Pieters when jumping. This appeared harsh: United\u2019s captain had not impeded the opponent so his strike was surely legal.", "This is where Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s men showed character: they refused to sulk and dug in, starting the second half on level terms and thus on course for the point required to move above Liverpool. Burnley had offered close to zero threat yet could still hope of nicking a goal and an unlikely win.", "United continued to set the pattern, a deflected Fernandes shot that yielded a corner showing as much intent as a buccaneering Pogba surge that scattered claret shirts around him. This created space for Martial to cross from the left: here was the contest\u2019s clearest chance \u2013 the ball teed up for Cavani at point-blank range but the normally lethal No 7 mis-kicked and Sean Dyche\u2019s side escaped.", "The miss illustrated a lack of composure where it counted from United. Fernandes let go a pea-roller from long range. Martial took the ball off Cavani\u2019s toes in the area to inadvertently thwart the Uruguayan. The Frenchman strayed offside when bearing down on Pope. Then Rashford unloaded loosely at near-range.", "But now came Pogba\u2019s sublime finish and a late rearguard effort from United. Martial may have limped off but this ended as an important night for Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s emerging side. There is a long way to go but they are in the perfect position to try to reach the promised land of a 21st championship."], "datePublished": "Tue 12 Jan 2021 22.29\u00a0GMT"}}
