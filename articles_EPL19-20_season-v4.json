They did not deserve more. Nor did Aston Villa, and that was frustrating for the hosts, who spent the last portion of the game mostly failing to trouble 10 men after Arthur Masuaku was sent off.", "Nearly all the home players threw themselves to the ground at the final whistle: this was an opportunity missed. Dean Smith has said since the start of the campaign that he expects home wins to form their basis for surviving, maybe even thriving, in the Premier League. So being unable to punish West Ham here hurt.", "While Villa lacked precision when it mattered most, there could be no questioning their desire – at least not after an extraordinary incident in the first-half between Anwar El Ghazi and Tyrone Mings. When the defender lambasted the midfielder for not tracking back hard enough, El Ghazi responded by pushing his forehead into that of his teammate in what could easily have been construed as a headbutt, albeit not a hard one. At least the referee, Mike Dean, remained level-headed and, after a review by VAR, he let El Ghazi off with a lecture. Smith said that, while El Ghazi was out of order, his players dealt with it so well that he did not have to address it at half-time.", "“I didn’t need to,” said the Villa manager. “There’s great togetherness in the dressing room. El Ghazi went over the edge of what we want and the players dealt with it swiftly. I’m happy for them to do that. We’re playing a team sport, it’s competitive and there’s heat-of-the-moment things that happen. It got dealt with very quickly. El Ghazi has a little bit of red mist in him, like most professional footballers.”", "There was no such forgiveness for Masuaku in the 67th minute, however. Already on a yellow card for a foul in the first half on Frédéric Guilbert, West Ham’s left-back invited punishment by grasping for Elmohamady’s jersey as Villa tried to launch a counterattack. When the Egyptian went down, Masuaku was sent off. “The typical second yellow card when you play away,” snorted Manuel Pellegrini, who claimed Villa were guilty several times of complaining about “fake fouls”. He made no mention of Mark Noble falling in the Villa box under no discernible contact.", "Pellegrini was pleased with how his team coped with going down to 10 men, agreeing with the midfielder Declan Rice’s opinion that West Ham would have lost in similar circumstances last season. “We have without doubt made progress in that sense,” he said. “We are working hard when we don’t have the ball and we are not conceding easy goals.”", "Villa, bright for most of the game, became less dangerous when their opponents were supposed to be more vulnerable. They did not create a clear opening until two minutes from the end, when Douglas Luiz clipped a nice pass over to Jack Grealish, who bungled an attempted volley from 10 yards.", "Grealish, eager to impress the watching Gareth Southgate, had a mixed game. He combined beautifully with Jota to produce Villa’s best chance of the first half, delivering a wonderful cross from the left. Wesley made a clever run to meet it but then headed over from five yards.", "West Ham mounted a counter-attack in the 20th minute, Andriy Yarmoleno providing oil in the form of a slick chested pass to Manuel Lanzini. Felipe Anderson crossed to Sébastien Haller, who got the jump on Tyrone Mings but nodded wide.", "Villa did most of the attacking, though, with Jota, Grealish, El Ghazi and John McGinn probing energetically on the platform given to them by Marvelous Nakamba who anchored midfield well on his debut before tiring and being replaced in the second half.", "Wesley was canny and dynamic in the way he led the line but, like his teammates, short of sharpness at critical moments. Villa, who can take encouragement from many aspects of this performance, are set for more frustration if they do not find a way of penetrating. That means keeping their composure better than they did after Masuaku’s red card, when the whiff of victory made them almost dizzy.", "“At 11 v 11 we were the better team and created the better chances,” said Smith. “The disappointing part is we never used our extra man well enough. We lost a little bit of emotional control and lost our structure. We had players giving sloppy passes away. We had players trying to do it all themselves, trying to take people on when you need to pass the ball a little quicker and draw people out. We didn’t do that in the last 20 minutes and that’s probably what were most disappointed about.”"], "datePublished": "Mon 16 Sep 2019 22.00 BST"}, "_Southampton_Sheffield United": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/26/southampton-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report", "Home team": "Southampton", "Away team": "Sheffield United", "Title": "Che Adams double gives Southampton comeback win over Sheffield United", "Body": ["No golden boot for Danny Ings but the silver lining here was a rare home victory for Southampton thanks to two goals by their less heralded striker, Che Adams.

Alex McCarthy made a couple of fine saves to stop United from increasing their lead before the hosts’ improvement.", "It was as tribute to both clubs that none of this mattered much in terms of final standings. “We finished ninth ahead of some giant clubs who’ve been in and around the Premier League for years,” said Chris Wilder, who was frustrated with this defeat but satisfied with the season. “I’m proud of the way we’ve attacked it. We’ve represented the club in brilliant fashion. We’ve had to do an enormous amount of things right to get into the top 10. We attacked the Premier League with respect but played, for the majority of the time, the way we wanted to.”", "Lundstram made the breakthrough here in the 26th minute thanks to a cross from the left by Enda Stevens and flimsy defending by Jannik Vestergaard.

But they had their pride and wanted to improve their home record, with only Norwich having a worse one than them in the Premier League this season. Hasenhüttl omitted Pierre-Emile Højbjerg amid active transfer interest from Everton or Tottenham Hotspur. “I just wanted to concentrate on the game,” said the Southampton manager.", "There was never any danger of Ings being left out, as he still had hopes of climbing to the top of the Premier League scoring charts. But both he and Adams were well controlled by the three visiting centre-backs in the first half. The only save that Dean Henderson had to make in the first period was from a gentle long-range effort by Nathan Redmond.", "At the other end, McCarthy prevailed in a one-on-one contest with Billy Sharp and then, in the 34th minute, made a tremendous save to deny Lundstram. “We should have been out of sight by half-time,” said Wilder, whose team dwindled thereafter.", "Sloppiness by United enabled Adams to equalise early in the second half. Chris Basham and Sander Berge were guilty of ropey passes before Adams beat the goalkeeper on loan from Manchester United with a shot that David De Gea would have saved. Probably.", "Henderson was blameless when Adams struck again for Southampton, finishing smartly from eight yards after John Egan blocked a shot by Walker-Peters.

The wait finally ended last month. The party really got going during, and especially after, another piece of history was made against Chelsea.", "Before climbing the steps to a specially constructed podium on the Kop to receive the title from Sir Kenny Dalglish, Liverpool’s players served up one more rousing and hugely entertaining display to end the league season unbeaten at Anfield. They have now gone three successive league campaigns without defeat on home soil.", "No other team in Liverpool’s illustrious history achieved that feat. A 59th unbeaten home game arrived courtesy of outstanding goals from Naby Keïta, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Roberto Firmino and the substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain – plus a more prosaic effort from Georginio Wijnaldum – and with a reminder to Chelsea of how far they have to go to be considered challengers at this level.", "Frank Lampard’s side could have secured Champions League qualification with a point at Anfield but, despite a late recovery inspired by the substitute Christian Pulisic, defeat means their hopes of a top-four finish will be decided on the final day.", "Chelsea were the more dangerous team until Keïta opened the scoring with a stunning effort, but it was to Liverpool’s immense credit that the post-match party never distracted from their duties on the pitch. And there was plenty to distract them. The fireworks started over an hour before kick off in nearby Stanley Park and intensified over Anfield throughout the game. A group of approximately 100 Liverpool fans ignored pleas to keep away and gathered on Anfield Road to greet the team bus. A security cordon kept them at a distance from the stadium but Merseyside police had to issue a dispersal order as crowd numbers increased during the night.", "Lampard’s team were in the ascendancy when the contest turned in the blink of Liverpool’s relentless pressing and Keïta’s unstoppable finish. The Guinea international, having dispossessed Willian with help from Wijnaldum, seized on the loose ball and had only one intention as he bore down on Kepa Arrizabalaga’s goal. His thunderous shot beat the Chelsea goalkeeper convincingly from 25 yards, kissing the underside of the crossbar on its way as the Liverpool bench exploded with joy.", "Alexander-Arnold doubled the champions’ advantage with another memorable free-kick reminiscent of his recent goal against Crystal Palace. Mateo Kovacic was eventually, and correctly, adjudged to have fouled Sadio Mané by the referee Andre Marriner, prompting a furious exchange between Lampard and the Liverpool assistant manager, Pepijn Lijnders. Chelsea’s manager was unhappy at Lijnders leaping from the bench after the foul. He sat back down, only to spring back up again as Alexander-Arnold swept the set piece past a rooted Arrizabalaga from almost 30 yards. The keeper’s movement, and lack of homework on the Liverpool full-back, were poor.", "Number three arrived when Andy Robertson’s corner caused havoc inside the Chelsea penalty area. Olivier Giroud’s headed clearance struck Jorginho’s arm and, while Mohamed Salah appealed for a penalty, Wijnaldum volleyed the loose ball into the roof of the Chelsea net. It was the 11th goal that Lampard’s team had conceded in their last four away matches.", "Liverpool were a class apart from the moment Keïta struck but Giroud gave Chelsea a glimmer of hope when he prodded home in first-half stoppage time, converting after Alisson had saved superbly from Willian. The glimmer was quickly extinguished.", "A strange quirk of Liverpool’s campaign was Firmino’s failure to score a single league goal at Anfield despite being fundamental to their success. That minor blemish was erased in fine style when Alexander-Arnold produced a perfect cross and the Brazilian, powering in ahead of Kurt Zouma and César Azpilicueta, headed past Arrizabalaga.", "Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/07/21-31139-gnl.fsof.20200721.ds.white_ball.mp3", "Chelsea could have been routed before a triple substitution by Lampard sparked improvement. Salah missed two excellent chances to become the first Liverpool player since Roger Hunt in 1965-66 to score 20 goals in three successive seasons.", "The visitors reduced the arrears again when Pulisic weaved his way past three Liverpool defenders and centred for his fellow substitute Tammy Abraham to tap home. Abraham returned the favour with a cross that Pulisic took on his chest before beating Alisson, but Oxlade-Chamberlain sealed the win in style when Liverpool broke superbly from a Chelsea free-kick.", "All that was left was the long-awaited coronation. Dalglish, a late substitute when Liverpool last received the championship on 1 May 1990, performed the honours while families of the players watched from the main stand. They had been allowed in after a U-turn by the local safety advisory group, on condition they watched the game on televisions in the stand.

With only two matches of the season remaining, the idea was to jolt the players into action. If Pozzo felt that they were drifting under their former manager, then something had to change and quickly. Could they eke out something extra under the interim coach, Hayden Mullins?", "The short answer against a Manchester City team that showed an absence of pity was no and the manner of Watford’s capitulation after Raheem Sterling had opened the scoring on 31 minutes was a worry. Mullins had set up to contain and the pre-match feeling was that even a narrow defeat might not be the worst result if goal difference was to be a factor in Watford’s bid for survival.", "Mullins and his players did not even get that and, with Aston Villa beating Arsenal later in the evening, the upshot was that Watford have slipped to third from bottom of the table – level on points with Villa but one goal worse off. They face a fraught finale on Sunday when they travel to Arsenal.", "This was as one-sided a game as could be imagined, the gulf in class and, as significantly, belief yawning wide. Sterling got his second in the 40th minute when he followed up to score after Ben Foster had brilliantly kept out his penalty and the second half was an ordeal for everybody who holds Watford dear.", "Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/07/21-58452-gnl.fw.20200707.sj.fweuropod2107.mp3", "Watford have parted company with permanent managers 11 times under the Pozzo family’s ownership since 2012 – they have sacked three this season – and out of the chaos came only misery here. For long spells, Watford could barely lay a glove on City and the hard truth was that Pep Guardiola’s team ought to have scored more.", "They had to be content with another two goals from Phil Foden and Aymeric Laporte; the first after Foster had denied Sterling in a one-on-one, the latter a header following a Kevin De Bruyne free-kick.", "It was the start of Mullins’s second caretaker manager stint of the season – one of the many unusual details to Watford’s situation – with the first having been in December when he lost at Leicester and drew at home against Crystal Palace. The task in front of him was enormous and not only because Watford’s previous two fixtures against City had ended in an aggregate 14-0 defeat.", "City had one eye on their Champions League last‑16 second-leg tie against Real Madrid on Friday week but they will not be able to merely switch it on when the Spanish club visit the Etihad Stadium. It is about maintaining the sharpness between now and then, both physically and mentally, and that meant finding a way through Mullins’s 4‑5‑1 system.", "For the opening half-hour, Watford remained compact and restricted City to a long-range shot from Rodri that deflected and forced Foster into a fine save. But it was always going to be a tall order to sit back and fend off City for the entire game.", "The tide turned sharply after City caught something of a break. Kyle Walker shaped to whip in a cross from the right only to get the technique wrong, dragging the ball lower and shorter than he had intended. Happily for him, Sterling had dropped into a pocket of space and the ball went straight to him. He controlled and fizzed a drive past Foster.", "City’s second followed a block tackle from Foden to win possession from Tom Cleverly and a quick pass forward to Sterling. The rest was all about Sterling’s footwork. He tricked Christian Kabasele into going to ground and glided around him before being caught by Will Hughes.", "Sterling went for power from the spot only to be denied by Foster, who got a strong hand up to claw the ball out. Sadly for him, Sterling was the only player to react and he rolled the ball into the empty net.", "Watford’s threat was slim to non-existent. City pulled them this way and that and Foster must have felt like the only line of resistance.", "For Watford, there was no out ball – only the grim inevitability that the scoreline would get worse. Foster thwarted Gabriel Jesus in a one-on-one in the 46th minute and he would also save from Sterling and De Bruyne while Adrian Mariappa was fortunate to avoid conceding a penalty when Bernardo Silva’s shot hit his hand.", "At the very end, Jesus had a header ruled out for offside.

Spurs do not always make smooth watching but they purred when given the invitation and struck brutally at the heart of Leicester’s frailties; it should now prove good enough for a Europa League spot and, from where they were, that may count as a season redeemed.", "This may yet become a campaign squandered for Leicester, who are now likely to find themselves behind Manchester United when they contest what is in effect a Champions League play-off next Sunday. They retain control of their destiny but this blow to their goals-conceded column may prove costly, and a repeat of the brittleness shown here will surely be punished anew.", "To anyone uninitiated with the nature of Spurs’ recent upturn, it might have been thoroughly remarkable that they went in at half-time with the outcome virtually sealed. Leicester had threatened regularly but they could not point to a lack of prior information: the past week had seen Arsenal and Newcastle both dismissed despite out-passing Tottenham, and Mourinho was never going to seek all-out control against his latest opponents, who pop the ball around far better than most.", "It took only six minutes for his approach to bear fruit again. Leicester had begun to find some rhythm but were quickly picked off and, even if the opener owed plenty to fortune, its conception was scintillating. Kane’s pass to Son Heung-min, delivered with the outside of his right foot from 20 yards inside the Spurs half, was beautifully weighted down the left channel and made an elegant spectacle in conjunction with the Korean’s bent run.", "Son had Ryan Bennett for company as he cut inside and his shooting angle improved when the defender stumbled. With a fair wind the resulting effort may or may not have faded inside Kasper Schmeichel’s left post; in the event, it clipped off the unfortunate Justin and flew the other way, rendering it unstoppable. A VAR check ensued, with an offside Kane running across the box as Son let fly, but his intervention was deemed harmless.", "The second and third goals were, primarily, evidence of Kane’s enduring excellence. But they also formed a harsh lesson for Luke Thomas, the 19-year-old Leicester wing-back who is deputising for Ben Chilwell. Having performed superbly against Sheffield United, Thomas looked the part for long periods again here, distributing intelligently throughout and providing a genuine attacking menace with his left foot.", "But when a clearance from Youri Tielemans’ corner was aimed his way in the 37th minute, his loose touch put Tottenham in their element. They were still 80 yards from the Leicester goal but Giovani Lo Celso and Lucas Moura made light of the distance, eating up the space before the latter found Kane’s diagonal burst with a cute through ball. The finish, rolled left-footed across Schmeichel, was consummate.", "Thomas had discovered that when your opponents are this good, imprecision can cost you anywhere. That had barely sunk in when, near the touchline, he was dispossessed by Moura and Spurs were away again. This time Moura’s pass seemed to have taken Kane slightly wide but it did not matter: he had time to bring the ball back inside and, having done so, curved an exquisite right-foot strike into the far corner. All three goals had arisen from Spurs’ rapid transitions upon winning the ball deep in their own half.", "Before the second of them, Schmeichel had saved sharply from Son. But his opposite number was the busier as Leicester probed to offset Justin’s misfortune. Hugo Lloris blocked a backheel from Jamie Vardy and then, with a quite exceptional save, plunged low to repel Ayoze Pérez’s volley. Thomas had delivered the cross for that chance, and also laid on a sight of goal for Vardy that Toby Alderweireld charged down. Lloris tipped over another Pérez shot before the interval; Leicester had been fairly good but, more pertinently, fatally naive.", "The game was up, although Kane’s quest for a hat-trick remained alive and it would have arrived early in the second period if Wes Morgan had not been alert. There was little change in the direction of play, just a softer sting to the action. Lloris, at his best here, acrobatically saved a free-kick from the substitute Demarai Gray and held on to a drive from Harvey Barnes.", "Leicester were now tied on plus-28 goal difference with United so it was in their long-term interests to at least reduce the deficit but, after one last Lloris stop from Kelechi Iheanacho, they were left with nothing bar a week to chew over their fate."], "datePublished": "Sun 19 Jul 2020 18.11 BST"}, "_West Ham United_Watford": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/17/west-ham-take-huge-step-towards-safety-and-push-watford-closer-to-danger", "Home team": "West Ham United", "Away team": "Watford", "Title": "West Ham take huge step towards safety and push Watford closer to danger", "Body": ["It is no use waking up at half-time when Premier League survival is on the line.

Alarm bells are ringing. Watford have lost their previous two encounters with City by an aggregate of 14-0 and their goal difference is already under threat after taking a few dents from West Ham, who rose six points clear of the bottom three thanks to goals from Michail Antonio, Tomas Soucek and Declan Rice in the first half.", "“I didn’t think we were resilient enough,” Pearson said. “It was not what I would expect from us. Whether that is the pressure of the situation, who knows. Now we have to find good performances in the last two games. We missed an opportunity. We haven’t done what we talked about doing. It’s annoying.”", "Watford deserved nothing despite a belated rally. They were timid without Étienne Capoue in midfield, shambolic at the back and incapable of containing West Ham’s attackers, who ripped the game away from the visitors inside the first 10 minutes. “The big thing was to get a win and get ourselves up the table,” David Moyes said. “It’s not got us completely safe but it’s got us in a really good position. We’ve done a good job.”", "It was too good for Watford, who allowed West Ham to take charge from the start. There were only six minutes on the clock when Antonio delivered the latest example of his improved finishing, collecting a flick from Pablo Fornals before firing past Ben Foster for his seventh goal since the resumption of the season.", "You might have expected Watford to pay close attention to Antonio given that nobody in the division has scored more than the forward since lockdown. Yet they were not alive to the threat from a player who put four past Norwich last weekend and they were just as dozy when Jarrod Bowen crossed for Soucek, who rose unchallenged to head home.", "There was no resistance as the Czech midfielder collected his third goal since joining West Ham in January. Soucek has been a smart addition from Moyes, who is entitled to feel he is on the right track. West Ham suddenly have a solid core; foundations to build on if they stay up.", "Bowen, another good January signing, impressed on the right and West Ham pulled clear nine minutes before the interval. Rice drove inside and let fly from 25 yards. The ball swerved past Foster; a fine way for Rice to open his account for the campaign.", "Watford were out early for the second half and Adrian Mariappa was on for Adam Masina, who paid for failing to deal with Bowen.

Sterling took a look, took a touch, and curled the ball low into the bottom corner.

They had picked a near full-strength side, with Bernardo Silva slotting into a front three in the absence of Sergio Agüero, and an agreeable tempo being set by Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne in the centre. Chelsea, meanwhile, settled in for the long haul, Mason Mount and Andreas Christensen particularly effective. Resisting City is as much a test of nerve as technique: let them pin you back in your own third and it might be 10 minutes before they let you out again.", "Yet for all City’s possession and territory, Chelsea largely held out for half an hour, their only real chances coming from a Riyad Mahrez interception and a Fernandinho header: the first gifted by a slack Kepa Arrizabalaga clearance, the second brilliantly saved by him. Have three minutes ever encapsulated Arrizabalaga better?", "Meanwhile, every so often something strange would happen: Chelsea would finagle the ball up the field and fashion a decent opening. Ilkay Gündogan was forced into a desperate clearance. Ederson saved brilliantly from Christensen. That seemed to flick a switch in Chelsea: the moment they sprang from their traps, and realised the game was there for the seizing.", "Even so, as Antonio Rüdiger headed away a City corner on 35 minutes, little immediate danger portended itself. But as Gündogan and Benjamin Mendy casually left the ball for each other, Pulisic stole in and claimed it, galloping past Mendy and placing a low shot past Ederson. Jubilant teammates pursued him to the corner flag. “Brilliant, mate!” shouted Olivier Giroud in what appeared to be a perfect Cockney accent. On the touchline, Frank Lampard urged calm.”We go again,” he said.", "And they did, but so did City. Bernardo and Rodri made way for Gabriel Jesus and David Silva. Mendy, seeking instant expiation, smashed a shot into the top tier of the Shed.

Raheem Sterling capped a brilliant counterattack by chipping against a post. Walker scraped the ball off the line after Pulisic had rounded the goalkeeper.

A fairly dismal few days for Burnley supporters in the wake of the 5-0 defeat at Manchester City was completed by frenzied speculation that Mark Hughes is favourite to take over should Dyche’s disenchantment lead to his departure, enough for someone in the streets outside the ground to make sure a “sack the board” message was sufficiently prominent to be seen.", "Played in energy-sapping temperatures, the match was evenly contested without offering a great deal of excitement until the winning goal arrived. Rodriguez had the clearest chances of the opening quarter, bringing a fine early save from Ben Foster with his first effort, then putting a shot too close to the goalkeeper after good work in the area from Matej Vydra. Rodriguez had the option to square instead of shooting, and might have been better doing that, but having decided to go for glory he really needed to produce a more convincing shot.", "Burnley’s twin strikers were both involved again midway through the first half in a passage of play that should have produced a goal.

The crosses were always well-flighted, but most were too close to Nick Pope.", "Cleverley failed to reappear for the second half, though Watford began with a greater determination to get forward, putting the home side under sustained pressure for the first time in the game. Not much came of it, apart from a wayward Will Hughes shot and James Tarkowski preventing Troy Deeney reaching a cross from Ismaila Sarr, but it was the first indication that the visitors might be interested in more than a point. Craig Cathcart might have done better when Pope made an unforced error and dropped a Will Hughes corner at his feet, though the substitute had his back to goal and after managing to turn could only come up with a shot that struck the now prostrate goalkeeper. Pope left his line and his area alertly to deal with a threatening break from Sarr 30 yards from goal, before Burnley had their biggest let-off, when Troy Deeney reached an Étienne Capoue corner with a goalbound header, only to find Dwight McNeil on defensive duty by a post and able to clear off the line.", "Watford were left regretting their inability to turn pressure into goals when Burnley hit back when they were least expecting it 17 minutes from the end. The home side had hardly troubled the Watford defence in the second half, yet when Josh Brownhill won possession in midfield and teed up McNeil for a cross from the left, Rodriguez appeared from nowhere to ghost in front of Dawson and glance the most delicate yet deliberate of headers past Foster. Each contribution by Brownhill, McNeil and then Rodriguez was noteworthy in its own right, though Watford may consider they were suckered into playing too high upfield then hit on the break.", "“We conceded from our goal kick, and that’s annoying,” Pearson said. “We spurned opportunities and made unforced errors.

Neither goalkeeper had much to do but stare at their own palms and the only moment of quality was one glorious volley attempt from Raúl Jiménez.", "Brighton opened the second half with much of the ball and, after another solid performance, Solly March was provided with the biggest chance of the game after a slick move ended with Leandro Trossard finding him unmarked inside the penalty area in a vast canyon of space. As was the case against Palace, his composure crumbled and he smashed the ball over the bar.", "As the home crowd buoyed them on, Wolves began to stamp their mark on the game. They finally found space on the counterattack through Jiménez and Diogo Jota. When Adama Traoré came on in the 64th minute, his majestic presence was immediately felt as he found Daniel Podence after a piercing run into the area. Podence’s strike was vitally blocked by Dan Burn and his chance to win the game in the dying moments was blazed over the bar. After a season of colossal comebacks and late goals for Wolves, this time it wasn’t enough.", "“We know our opponents, we know that today was gonna be like that.

The tide had largely been flowing in the opposite direction but in the 78th minute he applied the kind of finish that has defined his career.

Özil’s header across to Lacazette was precise and the first-time volley equally so. The celebrations were cut short by an offside flag and nobody, not even Arteta, initially sensed much cause for complaint. “When the goal was disallowed I thought: ‘OK, that’s fine,’” he said.", "However, Arteta was soon informed by his staff that something was amiss and, by that point, the lines and vectors at Stockley Park had whirled into action too. Not even the most painstaking examination of toe and elbow positions could rule Özil had edged in front of Aaron Cresswell when Aubameyang struck the ball, while Lacazette had even less of a case to answer. It took several minutes but eventually Kevin Friend, the VAR official, made the right call and Arsenal’s celebrations left no doubt about the moment’s importance.", "For David Moyes, whose setup could not be faulted, the frustration was clear.

This was a dogged fight back to winning ways after three defeats in four matches, one that began with conceding a controversial early goal to Callum Wilson, involved a spectacular goal-line clearance from James Milner and ended with a let-off from Nathan Aké in the 90th minute.

It was accompanied by the sound of 50,000-plus bums squeaking. Wilson clearly knocked Gomez off balance as they pursued a clearance into the Liverpool half. The ease with which the Liverpool defender was knocked off his stride was also apparent, so too the hosts’ failure to play to the whistle as Wilson found Philip Billing, who released Jefferson Lerma for a low cross turned in by the striker. Anfield waited for VAR to chalk off Wilson’s goal. Surprisingly the wait was in vain.", "Klopp and his assistant, Pepijn Lijnders, spent the delay raging at the fourth official. These tests rarely arise when everything is clicking seamlessly into place and a 30-year wait for the title becomes a procession. But here it was.

In the clear-up operation that followed, Steve Cook pulled his hamstring and had to be replaced by Jack Simpson. The departure of the disconsolate Bournemouth captain felt significant. Simpson’s calamitous introduction to proceedings ensured it would be. “That was the hammer blow,” said Howe of his captain’s exit.", "Simpson sent a routine clearance to the feet of a Liverpool player with one of his first touches. Moments later, receiving possession under no pressure deep in his own half, the 23-year-old miscontrolled and made matters worse by attempting to cut inside Mané. The Senegal striker relieved the substitute of the ball and found Salah scampering into the area. Mané misjudged his pass behind Salah but the Egypt international was able to collect, turn and squeeze his shot inside Ramsdale’s post.

How is it possible someone sits in a room and doesn’t see it?”", "The leaders were more controlled after the break, with Mané hitting the bar with a spectacular effort from distance, but they needed Milner to produce a superb goal-line clearance from Ryan Fraser’s lob over Adrián.

It was the seventh goalkeeping mistake that has led directly to a goal from De Gea since the start of last season, the joint worst record in the Premier League.

Calvert-Lewin almost scored a second in the fourth minute when a simple long ball from the recalled Michael Keane managed to pierce a static United defence.

If a match this fast, frayed and ragged was played 10 times, Arsenal would probably lose their fair share. But in Aubameyang they have an operator who, as Arteta said, appears re-energised by the demands being placed upon him; his second goal, heading in Nicolas Pépé’s cross with the second half less than half a minute old, was excellently taken and proved decisive after Leno made some vital late stops.

They were far too open and seemed likely to pay the price when Richarlison nodded down for Calvert-Lewin with 18 minutes to left, only for Leno to spread himself at point-blank range.", "The keeper then denied Richarlison and then, in a carbon copy of the earlier incident, the forward just failed to find Calvert-Lewin again. Arsenal maintained a threat, Nketiah hitting the bar, but there was still time for Calvert-Lewin, who grows in stature by the week, to glance just wide.

The presence of Christian Fuchs as a left-sided centre-back, though, offered some support for Ben Chilwell, who was left horribly exposed against Mahrez in the game at the Etihad, which City won far more comfortably than the 3-1 scoreline suggested.", "Jamie Vardy’s pace against a City side alarmingly vulnerable to the counterattack had been the main threat in that game and so it was again, the Premier League’s leading scorer hitting the post after eight minutes as he ran on to a Youri Tielemans though-ball.

Francis came across rather late with an ineffective challenge that left him on the floor, allowing Vydra to calmly slip the ball beyond the advancing Aaron Ramsdale.", "Out on the windy Moor the first half had been a collection of missed chances and wasted opportunities. Callum Wilson started it after just a couple of minutes, bringing a sharp reaction save from Pope when he probably should have scored.

The midfielder emphatically did not handle the ball: it came off a defender and hit him on the point of the shoulder. Billing made no movement with his arm towards the ball, which came at him from a distance of no more than a couple of a feet, but the law is such an ass at the moment that anything arm-related in the buildup to a goal cannot be tolerated.", "The visitors were still bewildered by the logic when their next chance arrived, Harry Wilson reaching King’s cross at the far post but failing to bury his header. Pope made an alert save, to be fair, though Wilson had a free header and the whole of the goal at which to aim. Dan Gosling got back well to take the ball off Vydra’s toe when it was Burnley’s turn to look like scoring, before Jack Stacey shot straight at Pope at the other end.", "Once they were 2-0 in front and playing against somewhat dispirited opponents Burnley had several chances to make victory more emphatic, notably when Vydra failed to hit the target at the far post and when McNeil crashed a shot against an upright 10 minutes from time. McNeil made up for that miss in the closing minutes, picking up the ball on halfway and driving though the Bournemouth defence to beat Ramsdale from the edge of the area.

They were given another reprieve when Jesus was played onside by Issa Diop to allow another close-range shooting chance. A goal looked certain, or at least another test of Fabianski’s reflexes, but Aaron Cresswell recovered well to get a foot in the way. The defender inadvertently put a hand on the ball as he stumbled in the challenge, but a more convincing case for a penalty was waved away on City’s next attack.", "Agüero was in on goal and just about to show Jesus how to finish when he found he could not reach the ball due to Angelo Ogbonna pulling him back. The referee was in line and could not form a clear enough view of the incident to award a penalty, though Agüero was bitterly disappointed when the assistant on the touchline simply indicated play on.", "After their frustrating experience in the 2-0 loss at Tottenham in their last outing, City could only be worried when the clock began to tick towards the half hour with the scores still level.

The Belgian began the move that led to City’s clincher, then after Bernardo Silva had turned Cresswell inside out he appeared at his teammate’s shoulder to take over and score.", "Silva might well have scored himself, but by this stage De Bruyne was not in a mood to take any chances with his colleagues missing chances.

It was that kind of match and Villa thought they had done enough to earn a point until a momentary lapse of concentration by Björn Engels right at the end. He let the ball run under his foot to give Son a clear route to goal. Son had been one of the players keeping Reina busy in the later stages but he was not going to miss such an opening, and he ran on to slip the ball beyond the goalkeeper as Engels and his drained teammates fell to the ground in despair.", "It was a cruel way to end a mistake-ridden but hugely entertaining game. On this evidence Villa should probably be higher in the table than they are at the moment, though they could do with a reliable goalscorer and a bit more luck. It turned out to be quite an afternoon for Toby Alderweireld who, in addition to being given a torrid time by Jack Grealish on Tottenham’s right, scored at both ends in the first half. Villa took the lead after just five minutes of an enjoyably hectic 45 that featured plenty of goalmouth chances for both sides, when Anwar el Ghazi turned Ben Davies on Villa’s right wing and sent over a cross that Alderweireld could only turn past his own goalkeeper under pressure from Mbwana Samatta.", "Villa were on top in the first quarter, with Grealish narrowly missing with one of his trademark right-foot curlers from the edge of the area, and El Ghazi having a shot saved by Lloris after Grealish had skipped away from Alderweireld to provide the cross. The Villa captain did the right thing on that occasion, setting up a teammate with a pass that deserved to produce a goal, though when he broke through again a few minutes later he would have been better taking on a shot himself than attempting to find a colleague in a crowded area.", "Spurs could easily have gone two goals down at that point, yet a couple of minutes later they were level, Alderweireld coming up with a splendid shot on the turn, when a corner came his way via a deflection off Danny Drinkwater, to beat Reina with a rising drive.

The VAR interpretation was probably correct, Engels ended up playing the man and hardly touched the ball. And though Reina reached Son’s penalty after standing tall during his stuttering run-up, he could not prevent the Korean tucking away the rebound.", "A feature of the first half had been the number of occasions Drinkwater gave the ball away to allow Spurs to launch quick counters, and the second half began in the same way. Bergwijn dispossessed Drinkwater on the half-way line and powered his way into the penalty area, and only a well timed intervention by Frédéric Guilbert prevented Spurs going further ahead. Instead it was Villa who found a second wind, levelling the scores just before the hour when Engels climbed above Alderweireld to head past Lloris from a Grealish corner.", "Reina kept out shots from Bergwijn and Son as the game continued to see-saw and was quick to deal with a Serge Aurier overlap after the impressive Bergwijn had played the full-back behind the Villa defence.", "Son broughtg another fingertip save from Reina as the game entered its closing stages, though the visitors’ best chance of clinching victory in normal time was when a mistake by Ezri Konsa left Alli in the clear.

We need more consistency; we have to improve.”", "Arteta was also disappointed with the Burnley pitch, even though it looked fairly normal to the untrained eye and was definitely the same for both sides.", "“Conditions were difficult,” he complained, in what can only be described as an Arsenal way. “The grass was long and they didn’t put water on it.

I didn’t water the pitch at the training ground yesterday.”", "If Arteta is still in place next season, he can expect as lively a reception as David Luiz received when he next turns up here. He was right about the finishing, though. The mystery at half-time was why Arsenal were not two or three goals in front, instead of moodily passing the ball around their own half with Mezut Özil summing up a particularly ineffective display by talking himself into a needless booking just before the interval. The visitors could have gone in front in under two minutes when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang picked out an unmarked Alexandre Lacazette with an inviting cross only for the striker to miss the target with a free header.", "Aubameyang himself was guilty of similar profligacy when he reached a long ball from David Luiz behind the Burnley back line. The hard work seemed to have been done when the offside flag stayed down yet Aubameyang came up with an uncharacteristically rushed finish, stabbing the ball wide with a clear sight of goal.", "When the next opportunity arrived courtesy of an excellent pass from Granit Xhaka the Arsenal captain unwisely tried to lob Pope . The goalkeeper stood tall, quite an easy thing for him to do, and saved comfortably, but once again Arsenal had failed to take advantage of a one-on-one situation.", "Not that Burnley’s finishing was any better. Jay Rodriguez brought a good save from Bernd Leno midway through the first half with a well-struck shot from outside the area but, when Shkodran Mustafi fell over in failing to clear a Dwight McNeil cross and the ball ran free to Jeff Hendrick at the far post, he wafted his shot wastefully wide with only the goalkeeper to beat.", "Burnley would barely have deserveda half-time lead but they had their chances, even if not all of them were as clear-cut as those of their opponents. It was a drab sort of game that badly needed a goal to liven it up, yet neither side proved capable of converting their openings.", "Xhaka and Lucas Torreira joined Özil in the referee’s book before the hour came up, marked by Hendrick missing the target from six yards from McNeil’s pinpoint cross. James Tarkowski and Ben Mee also headed wide from free-kicks in the second half, when it began to appear Burnley might profit from Arsenal’s indiscipline by scoring from a set piece.", "There was no such luck. Rodriguez scuffed a shot wide at one end, then Hector Bellerín dribbled promisingly into the penalty area at the other but opted to ignore the waiting Lacazette and Joe Willock in favour of trying his own luck and shooting inaccurately, before Aubameyang rose to meet a Lacazette cross and shaved the outside of a post.", "At least Aubameyang was close, though not as close as Rodriguez 10 minutes from the end when his close-range shot hit the crossbar and bounced down on to the goalline.

We were so fast in our passing and running off the ball and the control of the game. It’s a big win for us and one we must pick up on and replicate. It’s a nice example of the standard that we set.”", "Chelsea, who were without the injured Christian Pulisic and N’Golo Kanté, were ruthless and creative after three consecutive home defeats in the league. Lampard’s decision to use a technically proficient midfield trio of Ross Barkley, Mason Mount and Jorginho was bold and the hosts always looked too slick on the ball for their very physical opponents.", "Burnley looked to prey on the home side’s insecurities, putting numbers behind the ball and threatening from set-pieces, and their plan might have worked if they had shown more composure in both boxes during the first half. Chelsea had the look of a team playing on the edge when the game was goalless and were relieved when Jeff Hendrick’s header was ruled out for the tightest of offside calls against Ben Mee. The linesman’s flag had gone up when Mee headed on Dwight McNeil’s free-kick for Hendrick to turn in from close range and there was an anxious wait for Chelsea before a VAR review confirmed the initial decision was correct.", "Lampard was full of nervous energy on the touchline. He urged his players to maintain a brisk tempo during the early stages and applauded the way Barkley and Jorginho stretched the play with quick switches to the flanks. Reece James was a dangerous outlet, charging forward from right-back. Chelsea’s positivity was rewarded when Willian scuttled into the area before tumbling over a lunge from Matthew Lowton, Burnley’s right-back. Jorginho opened the scoring in the 27th minute, sending Nick Pope the wrong way with a cool penalty.", "Burnley had chances to equalise. McNeil saw a low free-kick tipped wide by Kepa Arrizabalaga and they almost scored from the resulting corner, only for Barkley to clear Mee’s header off the line. Chelsea’s defence still looked suspect in the air, though Lampard was encouraged to see Andreas Christensen take his chance on his first league start since the 3-1 defeat by Everton on 7 December. The Danish centre-back, reportedly a target for Milan, stood up well to the challenge of marking Chris Wood.", "Profligacy hurt Burnley, who are now four points above the bottom three after losing seven of their last nine league games, and Sean Dyche’s side let themselves down with some poor defending. Chelsea’s second goal was a case in point. James was allowed to dig out a cross before the ball ran behind on the right, Abraham bullied James Tarkowski in the air and Pope was far too slow to react to the striker’s header.", "Chelsea pulled clear at the start of the second half. Azpilicueta crossed from the left, Abraham missed the ball and Hudson-Odoi slid in to volley past Pope from close range. It was a cathartic moment for Hudson-Odoi, who suffered a ruptured achilles tendon against these opponents last season, and it summed up a restorative afternoon’s work for Lampard’s side."], "datePublished": "Sat 11 Jan 2020 17.08 GMT"}, "_Sheffield United_West Ham United": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/10/sheffield-united-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report", "Home team": "Sheffield United", "Away team": "West Ham United", "Title": "VAR denies West Ham point against Blades after goalkeeping woes return", "Body": ["If David Moyes was not already convinced that West Ham have deep-rooted goalkeeping issues to resolve in order to survive this season, he will be now.

It seems no Premier League game of significance is complete without a cameo from VAR these days – the fact that this intervention came deep into added time to deny West Ham an equaliser Moyes felt they deserved will have done little to appease him following the end of his unbeaten start in charge.", "When Robert Snodgrass seemingly scored in injury time, it sparked chaotic scenes among both the away supporters, while Moyes raced down the touchline to celebrate what seemed to be another important point for his new side. However, with the much-maligned handball law enforced by VAR after determining Declan Rice had handled in the build-up, the goal was disallowed. Naturally, Moyes was unhappy afterwards.", "“It was a good goal to me,” he said. “It looks like a law nobody is enjoying too much, but it looks like there’s a few laws nobody is enjoying too much.” But this was a night with other problems away from VAR too.

What their manager has felt, I’ve felt.” All that second-half drama, culminating in Snodgrass’s disallowed equaliser, thankfully overshadowed a fairly forgettable first half.", "There were few gilt-edged opportunities for either side in the opening 45 minutes, with the best falling to Felipe Anderson, who fired wide after sneaking through on goal. Moyes had opted to match the home side up tactically and while it certainly produced some resilience, it ultimately offered little going forward.", "Fabianski’s departure – “It looks like a recurrence of the same injury, we’ll have to get the tests done over the weekend,” Moyes said – was the one real talking point: and it turned out to be decisive. When Martin’s sloppy pass led to McBurnie’s fourth of the season, it forced the visitors into a tactical change. Snodgrass came on, West Ham reverted to a back four and with his first touch, his free-kick saw Sébastien Haller score – only to be disallowed by the offside flag. At the other end, Wilder’s side had chances to kill the game, and their profligacy in that regard looked as though it would hurt them deep into injury time.", "Rice surged forward, played in Snodgrass and he drove past Dean Henderson. That sparked delirium in the away end but of course, there was one final act to be written by Stockley Park. Moyes had barely stopped celebrating by the time VAR concluded that John Egan heading the ball into Rice’s arm constituted handball, which in turn produced the loudest cheer of the night for home supporters.", "The night began with West Ham supporters taunting the home side with Carlos Tevez chants, owing to the infamous chapter of history between the clubs over a decade ago.

We made a mistake trying to play football in our own half.”", "The most entertaining aspect of an unremarkable first half was Ancelotti’s range of shrugs, expressive gestures and eye-rolls on the touchline as he pondered some pretty ordinary football and probably started to wonder just how soon he would be able to lead Everton up the table.", "Unfortunately this practised theatricality was mainly for the benefit of those watching on television. The spectators who had paid to get in had to be content with Everton’s attempt to copy Burnley’s tactics by humping the ball into the box at every opportunity, even though Calvert-Lewin is often a hesitant finisher and Bernard lacks the inches to fight for headers with such as James Tarkowski.", "For most of the game Everton had more possession and shots on target than their opponents without putting Burnley under serious pressure.

When a Fabian Delph cross reached Calvert-Lewin a couple of minutes later he was unable to generate sufficient power in his header to trouble Pope.

The system was different but we couldn’t plan for that. We had no idea really what they were going to do.

There was talk of a need for all concerned not to go overboard and that is probably fair given that Watford remain bottom.

Instead he decided to chip Foster and could only look on with anguish as the ball sailed harmlessly over. It is more than 25 hours since Lingard’s last goal or assist in the league and, on the evidence of this display, he is not going to break that duck any time soon.

He hit a shot and, as had been the case at Anfield, it was poorly executed on the part of the 21-year-old Senegalese.

Watford were in control and United firmly on the ropes, paying for their sloppiness and lack of assurance in all departments.", "Solskjær reacted by bringing on Paul Pogba in the 64th minute, the Frenchman making his first appearance for United since September having been sidelined by an ankle injury, and while he injected urgency into their play, which led to a flurry of chances, it was not enough to spark a recovery for a team who had arrived only an hour before kick-off because of traffic and ultimately returned to Manchester with yet more doubts surrounding the ability of Solskjær, on the anniversary of his first match in charge, to instigate a genuine turnaround of a once-mighty institution."], "datePublished": "Sun 22 Dec 2019 16.09 GMT"}, "_Norwich City_Wolverhampton Wanderers": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/norwich-wolves-premier-league-match-report", "Home team": "Norwich City", "Away team": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "Title": "Wolves’ Raúl Jiménez completes comeback win to dash Norwich hopes", "Body": ["A week after beating Tottenham into submission but failing to find the nerve to finish them off, Wolves responded with a timely exhibition of their own fortitude by recovering from a harrowing first half and a goal down to see off a resplendent home side.", "After well-taken goals from Todd Cantwell and Romain Saïss, neither for the first or last time, it was Raúl Jiménez who broke the deadlock in the 80th minute.", "“Second-half much better,” said Nuno Espírito Santo, shrugging. “We adjust, we press high, we cover the ball, we create the chances, we managed the game.

The downside for Bruce was that, bar the moment when the Paraguayan’s pass left Isaac Hayden clean through and apparently certain to score before falling over, his side were creating half-chances rather than clear-cut openings and looked really dangerous only if Almirón or Jonjo Shelvey were in possession.

Graham Potter acted by removing Martín Montoya and Connolly for Solly March and Glenn Murray. United’s intent was illustrated by a Martial swivel and shot, then a James burst later.

Holgate flicked on towards Davies, who nodded in unmarked. With four minutes played, one could forgive Saints supporters for fearing the worst given it took Leicester twice as long to open the scoring en route to that trouncing.

At first, Attwell ruled it was not a penalty, only for a lengthy VAR check to reverse his decision. Justice was perhaps done when Krul easily gathered Rashford’s weak spot kick, although the Dutchman was soon having to pick the ball out of his net again.

Instead, what unfolded was a disrupted display.", "An illustration came early on when Riyad Mahrez found David Silva along the left; he had time to engineer an opening but this yielded nothing. Mahrez then committed a howler – the first of many from City – that had Guardiola crouching in anguish. This was a pass that went straight to Jiménez. He sprinted at Ederson down the middle and Fernandinho was needed to perform a double-block: first with a leg, then via his head when Patrick Cutrone followed up.", "Otamendi had been beaten with ease when Jiménez made room for his effort.

This time a combination of Fernandinho and Ederson kept the scores level, the No 9 ending on top of the latter in a sight reminiscent of mixed-martial arts.", "Guardiola has discussed the need to be more solid at the back with regard to eliminating “clear chances”.

City rushed towards the winger, though, and a shot that might have troubled Ederson was deflected away.", "Attack-as-defence is a truism of Guardiola’s virtuoso side, one he cited in the buildup. The problem, though, was a lack of a consistent edge near Patrício’s goal. When the blue wave next went at Wolves Raheem Sterling did cause the goalkeeper to beat the ball out. More encouragement came via a Cancelo shot, a Sergio Agüero header back at goal, and a Silva cross. Yet, Wolves held firm. As Nuno Espírito Santo noted afterwards his players pressing in numbers caused City to hurry. When Cancelo collected in front of the Wolves D, four black-shirted opponents stymied him.", "By the break City could reflect on a late Kyle Walker attempt, saved by Patrício, but the vulnerability in the rearguard was their glaring problem.", "The City full-back, recovering from an infection, was replaced by Oleksandr Zinchenko for the second half. This meant Cancelo going to right-back and the Ukrainian taking his berth.", "City, though, remained open to the counterattack. A Cutrone burst had Rodri scything him down, causing Craig Pawson to book the midfielder, the referee also showing yellow to Cancelo for an infringement earlier in the move.", "If Jürgen Klopp and his Liverpool players were watching the conclusion was clear: City lacked the vibrancy and ruthlessness that had swept them to the last two titles.", "If Jürgen Klopp and his Liverpool players were watching the conclusion was clear. City are lacking the vibrancy and ruthlessness that has swept them to their last two titles. The stuttering display had Guardiola introducing Bernardo Silva for Mahrez on the hour.

Nobody should realistically expect them to win that chase.", "Not that the lack of real quality – and it was startling at times – stopped the game from burning slowly into an entertaining contest. The first half, in truth, was a bit of a stinker. Or at least it was until McTominay grew weary of the torpor and, 20 yards out, smacked in a firecracker of a shot. After that, however, there was lots of drama and incident at either end, not least the equalising goal when Aubameyang was initially judged to be offside in the moments before he flicked the ball over David de Gea.", "It turned out to be a particularly poor judgment from a trigger-happy linesman and possibly the easiest VAR decision yet.

King benefited after the ball dribbled off Nathan Aké’s right leg from a deep Diego Rico cross. As he wheeled away, though, the assistant referee Constantine Hatzidakis raised his flag, only for the VAR, Andrew Madley, to overturn the decision. That was just the beginning of a contentious afternoon, with Aké having a volley ruled out after the offside Dominic Solanke clouded the view of West Ham’s goalkeeper Roberto, who replaced the injured Lukasz Fabianski.

Saying that, these teams were almost unrecognisable, with Howe and Pellegrini making a combined total of 19 changes from those defeats as they reverted to more tried and tested formulas here. That meant a return to the starting lineup for Yarmolenko, who built on his sweet strike against Manchester United last weekend with another finish full of panache. Felipe Anderson floated a cross towards Sébastien Haller.

Jordan Henderson acted as a decoy, Salah’s backheel teed up Alexander-Arnold and Chelsea froze as the youngster crashed a tremendous shot high to Arrizabalaga’s left.", "The opening period quickly became an ordeal for Lampard. His gamble on Emerson Palmieri’s fitness backfired when the left-back limped off, his defence was further weakened when Christensen made way for Kurt Zouma after suffering a knee injury and, on the one occasion Tammy Abraham managed to sprint away from Virgil van Dijk, the young striker failed to thread the ball past Adrián in the Liverpool goal.", "Lampard needed his team to be clinical, though he was encouraged by their willingness to keep probing.

The inevitability of the bumps on the way do not lessen the pain.", "One of the big questions was always going to be whether Solskjær’s line-up had the creativity to hurt West Ham. Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial were chief among the absentees and from the early stages it was plain that Rashford would have to feed on scraps.", "Manuel Pellegrini’s team had a nice balance, with Declan Rice in front of the back four and menace from the flanks in Yarmolenko and Felipe Anderson. They have generally proved a tough nut to crack this season and they took charge upon Yarmolenko’s goal, which was marked by precision and quality. With Andreas Pereira standing off, Mark Noble found Anderson and he was in sync with Yarmolenko.

But then Spurs stole the lead with an amazing breakthrough by Kane. The striker’s 170th goal for his club was unlike any of his others. It originated in a pass by Lamela to Son, who backheeled into the path of Kane. A shunt in the back from the retreating Caglar Söyöncü unbalanced Kane, who was falling as he beat Jonny Evans at the edge of the area.

With that in mind he was pleased to see Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen form a solid base in central defence, Danny Rose keep Wilfried Zaha quiet and Christian Eriksen knit everything together in his floating role in attack.", "“I think that showed the team was unsettled,” Pochettino said. “When the team is unsettled it is so difficult in the way you want to perform. I am not complaining. It is only that in football it is so easy to discuss situations and when the focus wasn’t to play football or to try to improve it is not easy to play. When you are focused it shows in the first-half performance of the team. I am so happy to recover that feeling. Now keep pushing. It is the first step.”", "By the end it was strange to think this had been billed as a potential banana skin for Spurs.

The timing of it boosted Arsenal and represented a body blow to Spurs. Kane would argue for a penalty at the very end after a challenge from Sokratis but it was the Spurs striker who initiated the contact.

It left Dean Henderson barely tested in goal.", "The downside for Wilder involved Vicente Guaita’s initially similar under-employment. Granted United did menace on the break – and particularly down their right side where Palace’s left-back, Patrick van Aanholt, repeatedly seemed badly positioned – but a generally underwhelming final ball dictated that Hodgson’s goalkeeper was rarely called to arms.", "Guaita did make one very important intervention late in the first half, though.

Krul was duly beaten by a precise finish into the far corner.", "Salah turned provider for the third. His corner was headed home by Van Dijk who had only to hold off Jamal Lewis and not even leap to beat the goalkeeper from close range.

Josh King, Dominic Solanke and Junior Stanislas scored the goals that brought a merited fourth away win of the season but, with confirmation of Aston Villa’s point at West Ham filtering through as they headed off the pitch, their victory was greeted with almost total silence. The damage, in truth, was not inflicted at the London Stadium. Four points from a possible 24 since the restart fatally undermined Bournemouth’s survival prospects before they arrived on Merseyside. Inflicting a first home defeat on Carlo Ancelotti as Everton manager was no consolation.", "The visitors’ approach and performance at the last could not be faulted. From the opening whistle Bournemouth were more motivated, aggressive and dangerous than an Everton team that had lapsed into coasting mode once again. “We had less motivation than the opponent,” Ancelotti conceded. “The players need to rest now after a long and complicated season and come back in mid-August with new energy and ambition.” Where Howe returns remains to be seen. The Bournemouth manager was non-committal on his future afterwards but, should he stay and keep the core of the team together, a big ask admittedly, the prospect of an immediate return from the Championship will look bright.", "Everton, laboured and careless, gifted Bournemouth the breakthrough from the penalty spot.

Zouma wasted a glorious chance from a corner, heading wide from close range, and Christian Pulisic forced Tim Krul to make a stunning save following a smart turn.", "Pulisic, always lively with the ball at his feet, looked the likeliest to pick the lock and so it proved on the stroke of half-time, the American teasing Norwich on the left before crossing for Giroud to head in from six yards.", "With the tension released, Chelsea ought to have been hungry for goals at the start of the second half.

He is desperate for goals.” Chelsea’s opener had been fortuitous. When Reece James played a pass forward, the Palace centre-half Gary Cahill was the favourite to get to it ahead of Willian. Then he was not. Cahill felt a stab of pain in his hamstring and slipped down in agony, unable even to watch as Willian streaked away to cut back for Olivier Giroud to finish.", "Should Willian have kicked the ball out?

The American darted outside Joel Ward and unloaded a vicious shot high into the near corner.", "With the influential Willian forcing Vicente Guaita into a low save, it was difficult to see a way back for Palace and yet the home team found one. It followed a sloppy turnover by James but when Patrick van Aanholt nudged a deflected ball square, it was all about the ferocious power in Zaha’s right foot.", "The winger looked angry at how the game was going and he channelled the rage into the shot from 25 yards, a celebration of technique which ripped past Arrizabalaga and into the roof of the net. The goalkeeper appeared to have it within his sights but he could do nothing about it – a bad look for him.", "The feel of the game changed sharply and Palace finished the first half in the ascendancy, with Zaha pepped and Benteke heading at Arrizabalaga. Chelsea needed another goal and Giroud ought to have scored it early in the second half only to send a free header high from James’s cross because Palace, particularly through Zaha, looked capable of hurting them.", "What had to worry Lampard was how easily Palace were able to play up to his backline. His midfield did not provide enough protection.

A mere two minutes separated Soucek’s celebrations and Shelvey guiding a shot into the bottom corner.

Dyche deserves plenty of credit for again devising an exemplary gameplan designed to neuter Palace’s multiple attacking threats.

Here again, Dyche was able to fill only five of his eight outfield substitute berths.

After this result, their supporters might be hoping chairman Steve Parish can persuade him to stay on for another decade.", "As usual on these occasions, there was a significant police presence outside the ground and there was no shortage of action in the opening exchanges on the pitch despite the early kick-off. A glorious pass from James McArthur which picked out Christian Benteke in the fifth minute could easily have given Palace the perfect start but the striker’s volley was nowhere near the target. His confidence in front of goal may be almost non-existent these days but the Belgian is always a danger in the air and it was from his header that Cheikhou Kouyaté had Palace’s next opportunity, only to be denied by a good save from Mat Ryan.", "Brighton were slow to find their rhythm but, having dominated large parts of the 1-1 draw between these sides at Selhurst Park in December, started to do so again. Neal Maupay’s shot was well saved by Vicente Guaita after a mistake from Wilfried Zaha gifted away possession, with the Ivory Coast forward – most definitely the pantomime villain in these parts – then getting himself into a heated exchange with Ezequiel Schelotto after the Brighton substitute kicked the ball at him after it went out of play. Replays appeared to show Zaha spitting on the ground rather than directly at the Argentinian. “I’m glad he didn’t lose his head,” admitted a relieved Hodgson afterwards.", "Solly March and Gary Cahill both then spurned excellent chances for their respective sides so an entertaining first half came to an end with no breakthrough but plenty of incident. There was another straight after the restart when Lewis Dunk’s goalbound header was inadvertently cleared by Maupay when the ball struck him full in the face. The Frenchman had ended his eight-match goal drought last week having previously not scored since the trip to Selhurst Park before Christmas and he could not take another excellent opportunity when the ball fell to him following Jaïro Riedewald’s slide tackle.", "Potter’s decision to introduce Murray alongside Maupay up front with 25 minutes to play was an indication of Brighton’s desire to claim all three points but it was Ayew who provided the game’s decisive moment after a brilliant reverse pass from Benteke."], "datePublished": "Sat 29 Feb 2020 14.38 GMT"}, "_Manchester United_Watford": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/manchester-united-watford-premier-league-match-report", "Home team": "Manchester United", "Away team": "Watford", "Title": "Bruno Fernandes opens Manchester United account in win over Watford", "Body": ["After a dour start this became the Bruno Fernandes and Anthony Martial show.

He swerved around Ben Foster and the keeper brought him down to concede a penalty.", "Fernandes took this with the swagger United have missed in recent years: an odd-looking hop straight up in the air sent Foster to his right before he slotted a first goal for United.

The teenager’s pivot-and-pass across Foster’s goal was inviting and Adam Masina was relieved to clear.", "What came next was a Martial special. The centre-forward had been quiet before waking to show his killer instinct. Fernandes was the craftsman, threading the ball through, and Martial the artist. When Foster blocked his initial shot the 23-year-old was in a cul-de-sac manned primarily by Étienne Capoue.

Villa were outclassed from start to finish with Southampton eventually building on Long’s early strike in second-half stoppage time when Armstrong swept the ball into an empty net while Pepe Reina made the pilgrimage back to his goal after going up for a late corner in vain.", "For Villa this was a damaging defeat and a worrying dress rehearsal for their date with City. Southampton, who had 28 shots, peppered the worst defence in the division – Villa have not kept a clean sheet on the road this season – and Marvelous Nakamba and Douglas Luiz were painfully overrun in midfield. There was equally little encouragement going forward, with Mbwana Samatta starved of service and Jack Grealish subdued by James Ward-Prowse. Villa’s single shot on target came midway through the second half.", "“The players have let themselves down with their personal performances,” Smith said. “I said to them before the game ‘we’ve got 13 cup finals.’ We got deservedly beat and players have played themselves out of another cup final next week. My feelings are embarrassment with the performance; it was a dreadful performance. They have to show me what they’re about. There’s too many training-ground players – if you want to play in the Premier League, you’ve got to go and perform on a match day. If you want to be a Premier League player, you have to go and perform week in, week out. I’m sure there’ll be a few players cowering behind the scenes when we do a debrief.”", "Villa’s anguish was Southampton’s gain. Will Smallbone, a 20-year-old academy graduate who joined the club aged eight, showed touches of class on his first Premier League start, receiving a warm ovation as he departed late on. Together with the captain, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, the hosts suffocated Villa. Ward-Prowse, another alumnus from the Southampton academy, was again excellent as an emergency right-back, shackling Grealish. “Prowsey, especially against players like Grealish and Zaha, can really dig into such a challenge and he is nasty to play against,” said Ralph Hasenhüttl, the Southampton manager. “This is what I hoped and he was often the fire-fighter in the last moments and did a fantastic job. It shows his fantastic character that you demand something and he says ‘no problem, I’ll do it’.”", "It took only eight minutes for Southampton to breach a discernibly frail defence, with the lively Moussa Djenepo beating Ezri Konsa to the byline before cleverly hooking a cross towards the front post with the outside of his right foot. Long was lurking and managed to steady himself to instinctively divert the ball beyond Reina with the top of his thigh. That proved the start of things to come, with the electrifying Djenepo, who has a tendency to flicker from the sublime to the ridiculous, twice going close to doubling Southampton’s advantage.", "Villa’s tepidness left Smith seething on the touchline but his players had nowhere to hide. They eventually conceded again when the substitute Che Adams superbly released Armstrong, who had earlier gone close after seizing on a mix-up between Reina and the fit-again Tyrone Mings, after the Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy punched a Villa corner clear. Armstrong struck to put Villa out of their misery, firing home from a tight angle. But they got off lightly.", "“It was a perfect afternoon,” said Hasenhüttl. “The only negative was that we had so many chances.

Giroud had started the move, flicking on to Mount, and the midfielder drove forward before squaring for Barkley.", "Spurs had flickered briefly towards the end of the first half, with Moura seeing a shot blocked by Azpilicueta and Davinson Sánchez extending Caballero with a header from a corner.

At one point Robertson found Trent Alexander-Arnold with a lofted pass from one touchline to the other, only for the right-back to send the ball immediately back in the direction it had come in an attempt to find Roberto Firmino in the penalty area.", "When Georginio Wijnaldum shot narrowly over from Sadio Mané’s pass midway through the first half there was a sense that another breakthrough might be imminent, though Mané chose the wrong option when Henderson ran half of the length of the pitch to release him, a slight miscontrol allowing the United defenders to funnel back and cut out his eventual cross.", "It was not quite all one way – Lys Mousset could have done better than shoot tamely at Alisson with an unmarked John Fleck calling for the ball at the far post – but United were indebted to Dean Henderson again when Mané nudged an Alexander-Arnold prompt into Salah’s path and the goalkeeper had to beat away a goalbound shot. Liverpool were at their most fluent when attacking at speed on the counter rather than attempting to pass their way through a packed defence. United knew that but were still obliged to come forward occasionally to try to get back on terms. Liverpool were not quite as sharp as they have been in recent weeks, with a few passes going astray and Firmino’s touch in particular letting him down in promising situations, and despite a wealth of possession in and around the Blades area they were unable to add to their lead before half-time.", "Firmino shot just wide at the start of the second half before Salah almost claimed a freak goal with an effort that trickled through a crowd of defenders and came back off a surprised Henderson’s right-hand upright. The goalkeeper saw the ball only at the last moment but acted quickly enough to prevent it trickling over his line. Mané’s goal, just past the hour, came from his own determined break down the right. He fed Salah in the middle and carried on running, so that the return pass found him in front of goal, where he was able to beat Henderson at the second attempt. It was a goal considerably less scruffy than it looked. Robertson’s initial pass to Mané was excellent, Mané’s intelligent run even better, and the coolness of Salah’s final pass almost sublime. He might not have meant to do exactly that, but it worked, and for Liverpool at the moment everything works and little else matters."], "datePublished": "Fri 3 Jan 2020 00.45 GMT"}, "_Arsenal_Chelsea": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/29/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report", "Home team": "Arsenal", "Away team": "Chelsea", "Title": "Misery for Arteta after Chelsea’s Abraham grabs late winner at Arsenal", "Body": ["Mikel Arteta put his hands up over his eyes and kept them there for a while before dragging his fingers down his face.

Mason Mount’s deep free-kick from the left looked like easy pickings for the goalkeeper, Bernd Leno, only for him to misjudge its flight and miss his punch in darkly comic fashion. Jorginho, the Chelsea substitute, was able to tap into the empty net at the far post.", "Should Jorginho have even been on the pitch? Already on a booking, he had flirted with another when he pulled back Matteo Guendouzi. The referee, Craig Pawson, gave him the benefit of the considerable doubt.", "Arsenal being Arsenal, they promptly caved in and lost. Chelsea broke from the edge of their own area, with the substitute, Callum Hudson-Odoi, winning a vital header against Guendouzi, and when Willian crossed, Tammy Abraham outfoxed another substitute, Shkodran Mustafi; dipping his shoulder, spinning and firing low past Leno.", "And so the first home game of Arteta’s managerial tenure fell apart. Arsenal remain in the bottom half and the broader picture shows that they have won only once in 12 Premier League games. Perhaps the biggest challenge Arteta faces is the rebooting of the collective mentality. Once again, the flaws were laid bare.", "Arteta’s despair was Frank Lampard’s joy. From the jaws of defeat, Chelsea snatched what was only a third win in eight league games to maintain their grip on fourth place. It would have been easy to imagine the inquest had they lost again but, although the equaliser was fortuitous, they deserved something for how they ended up controlling the game.", "Chelsea had started badly and Lampard felt compelled to reconfigure from 3-4-3 to 4-3-3 after 33 minutes. He introduced Jorginho for Emerson, moved Fiyako Tomori to right-back and César Azpilicueta to left-back. He argued that the tactical approach had not been wrong; rather it was the attitude of his players. They were lethargic, to use his damning criticism. He needed to make a gesture in order to shake them up. That said, Arsenal had pinned back Chelsea, who lacked balance and urgency in midfield. Jorginho would help to provide that.", "Arteta wanted energy: to him, it is the key to everything. He wanted to rediscover a connection with Arsenal’s supporters and Aubameyang’s goal provided the ideal building block. Mesut Özil’s corner was flicked on by Calum Chambers and Aubameyang twisted his body to direct a header past Kepa Arrizabalaga.", "That told only half the story because, from a Chelsea point of view, it was a dreadful concession, yet another from a set piece. Tomori was beaten too easily in the air by Chambers and at no point did Emerson have a bead on the whereabouts of Aubameyang.", "Arteta set up in a 4-2-3-1 formation with Özil showing his skill and range of passing in the No 10 role. He peeled towards the right to create overloads as Arteta initially targeted the flank guarded by Tomori and Emerson and there was plenty to offer encouragement. The home team, who lost Chambers to a serious-looking injury, might have had a second shortly after the opener only for Alexandre Lacazette to fail to kill a lovely Aubameyang layoff.", "There was needle. David Luiz, the former Chelsea defender, rushed into a full-blooded clearance and left his boot high around the head of N’Golo Kanté; fortunately, there was no connection with his former teammate.

Chelsea came on strong in the second half, showing greater fight and, as Arsenal defended deeper and deeper, the question was whether Lampard’s team could create and, crucially, convert something. Profligacy has been their enemy this season.", "Lampard sent on Tariq Lamptey at right-back for his debut and the 19-year-old showed his fearlessness, with his best moment being a pass to play in Abraham. David Luiz got across to make a saving tackle, with Azpilicueta looping high on the second phase, while Abraham also missed a free header from a Willian corner.", "It could have been different had the Arsenal substitute, Joe Willock, not flashed narrowly wide on 78 minutes when gloriously placed but Lampard could argue with some conviction that Chelsea had earned their luck for the equaliser.

The first came within seconds when Miguel Almirón should arguably have collapsed under considerable pressure from Michael Keane’s arm after being put through on goal by Joelinton but instead stumbled before shooting wide. A potential penalty and red card at that point could have set a very different tone but, instead, Ancelotti merely wagged a disapproving finger. Suitably warned, Everton swiftly looked considerably slicker, sharper and speedier than their hosts and few were startled when Calvert-Lewin scored his second goal in three days.", "It arrived when the fallout from Gylfi Sigurdsson’s initially blocked free-kick was deflected into the path of the striker, whose close-range shot evaded Martin Dubravka’s reach. No matter that it was all a bit scruffy; Duncan Ferguson celebrated as if it were a cup-winning goal he had scored himself. As Ancelotti kept his cool, standing impassively on the edge of the technical area, his assistant bounded past him, almost knocking the manager over as, arms aloft, he burst out of the dugout and on to the pitch.", "Unlike Ancelotti’s No 2, Carroll is a far-from retired throwback centre-forward and, by way of proving it, almost singlehandedly dragged Newcastle back into things, disrupting the growing visiting dominance while setting teammates a toweringly defiant example. Whereas previously it had been all about Theo Walcott’s menacing advances and Kean’s excellent movement, suddenly Carroll was here, there and everywhere, making vital interceptions at both ends and raising Joelinton’s game to new heights along the way.", "Everton’s penalty area was subjected to a sustained attacking assault with Jordan Pickford – as a former Sunderland goalkeeper, the afternoon’s pantomime villain – doing well to palm Schär’s high-velocity shot to safety. Ancelotti had much to contemplate as he dug his hands deep into the pockets of his classically tailored dark overcoat, particularly after Carroll – who else? – rose imperiously above all-comers to head Jetro Willems’s free-kick down for Schär to volley beyond Pickford.", "Everton’s manager responded by introducing Delph and the latter’s solidifying presence offered the Merseysiders a counterattacking platform, providing a superb springboard for Richarlison’s exceptional pace. When Carroll conceded possession it was Delph’s neat pass under pressure that initiated the break from which the visitors restored their lead.

His opening action was a crafty dummy that allowed the ball to roll to Martial in the area. Next, a 20-yard shot that just missed the outside of Dubravka’s right post solidified the sense Pogba could help wrap up the result quickly, and moments later United had a fourth goal for only the second time in the league this term.", "Again this was self-inflicted by Newcastle: Sean Longstaff swivelled near halfway and hit the ball back but only into Martial’s path. He sprinted in and despite a heavy touch still dinked the ball over the advancing Dubravka. United were now rampant.

Eyebrows were raised at the omission of Tanguy Ndombele and it was hard not to see the decision to start a player of Sessegnon’s inexperience over Eriksen as an indication that Mourinho is planning for life without his most creative player.", "The manager said of Ndombele, the record £53.8m signing: “Yesterday he told me he was not feeling in condition to play the game.

Leighton Baines delivered from the right, De Gea, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Mina in attendance, flapped and the loose ball rebounded limply off Lindelöf into the net.", "VAR ruled the goal legal but Solskjær was unhappy at the decision. “You shouldn’t concede goals like this at set plays,” he said. “But it’s a clear and obvious foul. There’s no point me complaining but his [Calvert-Lewin’s] arms are over David’s shoulders as he was going to punch it.”", "Maguire agreed. “It was a clear foul,” said the centre-back. “People will say David de Gea has to be stronger but it is a clear foul.

Not all of Villa’s recent additions have thrived, with Wesley, low both on confidence and useful service, looking forlorn here before being withdrawn in the 70th minute when Villa were in urgent need of a goal. “He took a whack in the lower back and I thought Jonathan Kodjia deserved an opportunity,” Smith said.", "United, by contrast, are a team with exceptional cohesion and no obvious shortcomings. For all that, the first half here was appalling, like a re-creation of some skirmish from the nether leagues. Neither goalkeeper had a shot to save.", "John Lundstram did poke an effort towards goal before the break but it was blocked by Kortney Hause. That intervention may not have been necessary because it was questionable whether the shot from 16 yards had enough power to make it as far as the goal but at least the defender was well positioned, which was worth noting as the 24-year-old was making his Premier League debut in the absence of the injured Tyrone Mings.", "Given how Villa were torn apart by Leicester last week, Smith took a measure of satisfaction from how few chances his team gave up in the first half here, even if that was partly down to United being uncharacteristically slipshod.", "Villa’s attacking was lamentable.

This victory takes them to 20 points from 10 games, one more than their total at this stage when they went on to win the league against all odds. For Southampton, who had Ryan Bertrand sent off 12 minutes into this non-event, this was an ordeal from start to finish. The visitors shot Saints to pieces, with Ayoze Pérez also helping himself to a hat-trick to celebrate his first goals in a Leicester shirt as Brendan Rodgers’s boisterous side cantered to an embarrassing rout that laid bare his side’s top-six credentials while exposing familiar flaws in the Southampton defence.

Leicester ran riot and at times the suffering they inflicted on Southampton felt unfair. The gulf between the sides was alarming, reminiscent of a charity fundraiser whereby the scoreline is secondary.

Up next? The champions. Away. Twice: first on Tuesday in the Carabao Cup and then next Saturday in the league. “Manchester City, we’re coming for you,” came the ironic chant from crestfallen supporters before the final whistle.

It was the third time this season that Villa have had disallowed a goal ruled out after a review by VAR but Smith found this decision even more difficult to accept than the ones against Burnley and Crystal Palace. “For the first time, I believe, VAR has got involved in a subjective decision,” said Smith. “I must have missed the memo where they said that’s what it is for.” Good thing, then, that Grealish struck a legitimate equaliser moments later.

Only Hughes will know how he did not improve that ratio when, in the 55th minute, he met Gray’s fizzed centre at the far post after the striker had skipped around Lukasz Fabianski. It was a sitter but, perhaps seeing the ball late, Hughes turned it wide from a matter of inches. These things happen but Watford, who disintegrated thereafter, are in such desperate form that he may not see the funny side for some time.", "“The dynamic is not good; we need to improve something,” said Gracia, whose team have lost seven games in a row and gone 18 without a clean sheet.

A minute had passed when Haller fudged a goalscoring opportunity but managed to chip across the area to Manuel Lanzini.

It was another second half when Chelsea underwhelmed, echoing last Sunday’s collapse against Manchester United, and the awkward truth is they were fortunate not to concede again once Wilfred Ndidi had cancelled out Mason Mount’s opener.", "Not that it was all doom and gloom for Chelsea’s new manager. Indeed there were some good signs for Lampard, not least a mature display from Mount, whose first Premier League goal is unlikely to be his last. From a collective perspective, however, Chelsea have issues to resolve. Their midfield found trying to keep track of James Maddison too much for them as an absorbing game wore on and Rodgers was not wrong to say that Leicester had the chances to earn their first win of the season.

Stamford Bridge was rocking before kick-off, with the optimistic mood summed up by the “Welcome Home Super Frank” banner in the Shed End, and the home side was full of creative energy as they attacked that end from the opening whistle. It was relentless and they almost scored with their first attack, Pedro volleying just wide after a clever lay-off from Olivier Giroud, who briefly looked in the mood to bully a defence weakened by the sale of Harry Maguire to United.", "The absence of Ben Chilwell at left-back made Leicester’s back four even more vulnerable and they were slow to react to the obvious threat from Chelsea, who were pressing high in an attempt to force errors in dangerous areas.

Eager to show that he has been listening to Lampard, Mount sprinted forward and won the ball with a challenge that left Ndidi on the ground. At least the Nigerian had a good view of the youngster demonstrating why Mount has been compared to Lampard as he kept his balance and drilled a low, hard finish past Schmeichel from 18 yards.", "At that stage, with Chelsea rampant and Stamford Bridge bouncing, Leicester must have feared the worst but there was always a suspicion that Chelsea would struggle to maintain that early tempo after their exertions against Liverpool in the Uefa Super Cup in Istanbul last Wednesday.

Hamza Choudhury stamped his authority all over midfield, Jamie Vardy’s speed unnerved Chelsea’s suspect back four and an equaliser looked certain when Maddison rounded Arrizabalaga, only for Mount to demonstrate his team ethic by stopping Youri Tielemans from tapping into an unguarded net.", "The mood had changed and Lampard could sense which way the wind was blowing. He tried to jolt his side into life by replacing Giroud with Tammy Abraham, who was the subject of racial abuse on social media last week, but the problem was in the middle, where N’Golo Kanté and Jorginho were given the runaround by Leicester’s creators, Maddison, Ayoze Pérez and Tielemans.", "Maddison was pulling the strings for Leicester and it was the England international who created the equaliser in the 67th minute.

The keeper gave a spirited Southampton a lifeline after Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino earned a healthy two-goal cushion. Just as a tricky afternoon on little sleep and minimal preparation seemed to have turned into a breeze, Adrián’s clearance from a nonchalant back pass by Virgil van Dijk cannoned off Danny Ings’s shin and into the back of the net.", "It was a mistake fit for an end-of-season blooper reel and it had shades of Alisson’s error against Leicester City last September, another game which threatened to run away from Liverpool.

On Friday they boarded another flight, this time to Southampton.

Then they [Southampton] came up [the pitch] and Ings had a big chance and that’s normal. In that moment, I think the boys felt the tiredness. That was the moment: ‘Really? Now we have to go again.’ But we kept the result, I think we deserved the three points and I’m completely fine with that.", "“I said to [Adrián]: ‘Well done. Ali did the same. It’s a goalie thing to do at Liverpool.’ But no problem if we win the games. We played too many balls back to him in this period. I was happy with all of the stuff he did, all of the saves. The other players needed to feel more the responsibility in the buildup. You cannot give all of the balls back to him and hope the painkillers still help.”", "Adrián was passed fit at 10am and it had all been going swimmingly on his first Premier League start for the club, the goalkeeper pulling off fine saves from Maya Yoshida and from his own defender Joël Matip to shut out Southampton before gifting Ings a goal against his former club.", "The agonising thing for Ings and Ralph Hasenhüttl is that the substitute, who completed a £19m move this summer, should have restored parity but failed to convert Yan Valery’s cross from close range.", "“Ingsy scored once but I think he could have been the big hero for us,” Hasenhüttl said. “The second chance to miss was unbelievable. We had three men in the box there at that moment but didn’t bring the ball over the line. That was really a pity, I must say. I think the guys, for what they invested today, they deserved to take one point and we didn’t. That’s tough to take, but finally we have to.”", "Until Mané’s delicious, curling strike on the brink of the interval, Liverpool had huffed and puffed.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was outstanding before being replaced late on by Jordan Henderson, who was one of three players given a breather here after going the distance in Turkey in midweek. That allowed Klopp to field his fabled front three of Mané, Firmino and Mohamed Salah for the first time since lifting the Champions League trophy in Madrid.", "Liverpool’s attacking trident has long been their pièce de résistance under Klopp and their ruthless streak compared with Southampton’s profligacy in front of goal – typified by Ings’s glaring miss in the dying moments – was ultimately the difference.", "Che Adams’ first-half header sailed over the bar but the visitors also wasted chances, with Salah and Firmino both squandering presentable opportunities before the latter danced inside to squeeze home Liverpool’s second with 19 minutes remaining.

Yet this was the fifth season in a row United have won their first game and the last time that happened in the top division was 1910 – the very year that Old Trafford opened for business.", "Not that anyone should be getting too carried away just yet or, indeed, thinking Mourinho might have been wrong. A 4-0 winning margin does not quite tell the full story, particularly when taking into account a first half in which Chelsea’s players often gave their opponents the run-around, hitting the woodwork twice as well as creating all sorts of danger.", "Ultimately, though, it turned into a chastening experience for Frank Lampard, taking charge of his first match as Chelsea manager. Marcus Rashford, in particular, profited from Chelsea’s shortcomings in defence, opening the scoring with a first-half penalty and then racing away to put in the third goal little more than a minute after Anthony Martial had doubled United’s lead. The indignities for Lampard were stacking up and he had to endure the now familiar “sacked in the morning” chant after Daniel James confirmed United’s second-half superiority late on with a debut goal, eight minutes after coming on as a substitute.", "Yet the more pertinent song, perhaps, came a few minutes earlier when the Stretford End made it clear what they thought of Graeme Souness, the long-term critic of Paul Pogba. Pogba had just supplied the best pass of the match to dissect the entire Chelsea defence, resulting in Rashford sprinting through the middle to slip the ball past Kepa Arrizabalaga and make it 3-0. Pogba also supplied the decisive pass for James to score with a deflected shot and, on this evidence, maybe even Souness might be forced to concede that the French World Cup winner can bring more good than bad to this club.", "Pogba was the last player to leave the pitch, staying back to applaud the section of the Stretford End that has not always ushered him down the tunnel so warmly. It felt strategic as if he wanted to repair some of the damage from having said he wanted to find another club.", "The second half was a strange capitulation on Chelsea’s part because the paradox of this game is that for long spells they passed the ball with more clarity. They certainly had the better of the opening 45 minutes but still found themselves behind due to Kurt Zouma’s mistimed challenge bringing down Rashford just inside the penalty area. It was a straightforward decision for the VAR officials and, though Kepa dived the right way, Rashford’s penalty was a mirror image of the one he scored so memorably against Paris St-Germain last season – struck powerfully, to the goalkeeper’s right, and still rising as it hit the net.", "Until that point Lampard must have been encouraged by the adventurous approach of his team. Tammy Abraham, spearheading their new-look attack, had flashed a 20-yard shot against David de Gea’s right-hand post. Mason Mount, operating in the number 10 role (albeit wearing number 19) looked determined to show he could flourish at this level,having spent last season on loan to Derby County in the Championship. Pedro had one of his better games and Ross Barkley was quick to support Abraham when the team broke forward.", "United, in comparison, needed the opening goal to bring them alive and even then Chelsea had enough chances to feel aggrieved to be behind at half-time. Emerson, in particular, was unfortunate with a rising left-footed shot that beat De Gea but flashed off the crossbar. Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s saving tackle on Barkley drew an almighty cheer from the home crowd and Harry Maguire, another debutant in United’s back four, certainly won his fair share of headers on a day when Solskjær did not even include Chris Smalling, Phil Jones or Marcus Rojo among the home team’s substitutes. Overall, however, the opening hour was not easy whatsoever for United’s new defence and they rode their luck at times. Chelsea were just too naive, perhaps, to make it count – too open, too wasteful in attack, too obliging with their marking.", "There is also a great statistic from the Premier League era that shows United have never lost any of the 280 games when they have had a half-time lead on their own ground (winning 264 and drawing the other 16). More and more it is also becoming evident how Solskjær intends to line up his attacking players this season. Here, he started with Andreas Pereira just behind Martial, in the most advanced position. However, there were times when Jesse Lingard, who began on the right, exchanged positions with Pereira whereas Martial and Rashford did the same on the left. Martial has taken on Romelu Lukaku’s number nine shirt and he certainly finished like a number nine when Pereira swung over the cross for United’s second goal.", "Pereira had justified his selection. Scott McTominay did, too. Maguire and Wan-Bissaka can reflect on a satisfactory start (Maguire-watchers will also have noted the move for the fourth goal began with him dispossessing Abraham on the edge of his own penalty area).

If it sounded like damning Barnes with faint praise, Dyche added: “He doesn’t go under the radar here.”", "His exploits had an importance. Burnley mustered only 12 points in the first half of last season; they are a quarter of the way to that tally already after a masterclass in efficiency.

When Erik Pieters hooked the ball forward, it should have been a simple header for Jannik Vestergaard, even in the swirling wind. But the £18m defender misjudged it, failed to make contact and Barnes darted in behind to make a sweeter connection with a half-volley. “A fantastic touch and finish, it was great skill,” said Dyche. “He hasn’t scored in pre-season but he didn’t look like a striker who hadn’t scored.”", "It was an ill-timed error by the Dane, with the Augsburg defender Kevin Danso joining on Thursday and set to link up with his new colleagues. “It is important to have more alternatives in the defence; not only this game showed it,” said Hasenhüttl, while affording Vestergaard little support as he made himself a candidate for demotion. “I don’t know why the centre-back missed this ball,” he said.", "If Pieters, a cut-price arrival from Stoke, represented one of the transfer window’s less glamorous arrivals, he offered indications he could be an astute acquisition. “Erik has laid down a real marker,” Dyche said. He set up Barnes’s second goal with a pinpoint cross that the striker met with a crisp finish.", "As the floodgates opened on the dampest of days, Johann Berg Gudmundsson whipped in a third goal from an acute angle, nicking the ball from Ryan Bertrand and advancing to bend a shot beyond Angus Gunn.

The Tottenham manager was incensed by the failure to award his team an early penalty when Kane was sent tumbling in the box by King, who was guilty of shoving the striker, lurking at the back post at a corner, as he went to meet the ball.

Callum Wilson returned with a spring in his step after a two-match ban, while Bournemouth’s substitutes reacted like paying supporters, applauding every interception and block, with the midfielder Dan Gosling particularly impressive on his first start since February. Tottenham’s performance was typified by Harry Winks waywardly passing out to Son, warming up on the touchline, instead of Ben Davies.", "The injury to Smith, which came moments after he was winded by a Kane free-kick, allowed both teams to rest, with Howe urging his team to refocus and not undo all of their hard work.

The manager particularly prizes Nketiah’s hounding of opposition defenders but, with his first significant involvement, he went too far. As the ball bounced towards the Leicester defender James Justin near halfway, Nketiah closed in but his effort to win possession manifested itself in a late, knee-high challenge that looked less edifying with every subsequent VAR replay, making it inevitable that Chris Kavanagh would show a red card.

That changed after their numbers were reduced and the equaliser, while converted with relative ease by Jamie Vardy at the far post, was a peach. Demarai Gray, showing how constructive a substitute can be, bent an undefendable ball behind Arsenal’s back line from the right and Vardy’s 10th goal in as many starts against this opposition may prove one of his most important.", "It survived a lengthy VAR check, with eyes at Stockley Park trained on Ayoze Pérez’s attempt to connect before the ball reached Vardy.

Dani Ceballos, who has played himself into contention for a longer stay in recent weeks, sent Bukayo Saka away on the right with a perfectly weighted pass that the lunging Caglar Soyuncu could not intercept. Saka would have fancied himself one-on-one with Jonny Evans at the outset but his task was made easier when the centre-back stumbled. It meant half of the penalty area was at his disposal and he made good use of the space, laying on a finish for Aubameyang that Vardy would almost exactly replicate later.", "For the next 25 minutes Arsenal played with more consistent menace than at any point this season. Saka was everywhere, forcing Kasper Schmeichel to save with his legs and then teeing up Lacazette for a shot on the turn that was again repelled.

With the ball, although far from ingenious, they at least passed crisply and moved continuously. So did Wolves.

VAR required more than two minutes to decide whether the ball struck Keane’s head or hand before finding its way on to Ndidi.

Now, with Fernandes on board and every other key player fit, United are better equipped to play through opponents.", "They can still counter-attack as they did to devastating effect for their third goal, which was superbly finished by Fernandes.

Within 10 minutes they caught four decent glimpses of Mat Ryan’s goal, coming closest from the third when Bukayo Saka jinked inside on to his right foot and produced a whipped, rising strike that rebounded off the crossbar with Ryan left standing.", "Saka was playing on the left of a midfield three, a setup that showed necessary intent, with the caveat that Arteta’s midfield resources are stretched. While Brighton stabilised, Arsenal continued to ooze threat. Ryan, who went on to have an outstanding game, was obliged to save a stooping header from Alexandre Lacazette, another mercurial forward who had earned a recall, while Adam Webster intervened brilliantly just before the interval when Lacazette’s backheel appeared to have played in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.", "Between those two chances came Leno’s departure. The stoppage lasted five minutes and as he was being carried off on a stretcher he sat up to make his feelings known to Maupay. A jabbing finger needed no interpretation and, in the circumstances, Maupay’s apparent protestation was not the best look.", "At least Emiliano Martínez, the replacement keeper, showed commendable alertness to save a fizzing shot from Aaron Mooy within a minute of play restarting, his teammates still reeling.", "Maupay served notice of his ability to compound the agony when, before the hour, Martínez beat away his drive from near the byline. But Ryan remained the busier keeper and twice thwarted Aubameyang, who might have regretted that both opportunities fell on his weaker, left, foot.", "No matter – or so it seemed – because prowess with the left is one gift of Pépé’s that has appeared beyond reproach. He strikes the ball beautifully and proved as much again when, fed by Saka on the right, he took a touch inside the substitute Solly March and beat Ryan all ends up with a luscious curled finish.", "How frustrating for Arteta, then, that within seven minutes the goal should be cancelled out so scrappily. March’s low cross appeared to take a nick off Saka and was scrambled away from goal before Dunk, sliding in, made just enough contact to force it over the line.", "And how sickening that, after Aubameyang had made Ryan save once more in spectacular fashion, Maupay ran through to finish sublimely from an angle and wave a rag redder than the Arsenal shirts."], "datePublished": "Sat 20 Jun 2020 18.41 BST"}, "_Norwich City_Southampton": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/19/norwich-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report", "Home team": "Norwich City", "Away team": "Southampton", "Title": "Southampton's Danny Ings eases back into groove by sinking feeble Norwich", "Body": ["For Norwich the restart is over before it truly began.

They are now 10 points clear of the drop zone. Surely all but safe, Ralph Hasenhüttl’s men gave a performance – especially in the second period – that did the players and the manager real credit. Not only stronger and technically better, they were cool and decisive too. This last quality comes with a proviso: due to the empty surroundings it was impossible for anyone not to hear Hasenhüttl’s numerous instructions to his players, specific down to the very direction of each pass and its timing.", "“In the end the result was absolutely deserved‚” Hasenhüttl said. “We didn’t have a good start but it was getting better and better the longer the game went on. We had a few good chances in the first half but that last pass was not perfect. In the second half Ingsy made the opener and after that we deserved it, we never lost our aggression or our passion to get the ball.”", "“I trust my players and I was fully convinced we could win this game,” said Farke. “Just because of the points we have to win five games, when you lose the first game it’s getting even a bit more difficult. But we wouldn’t dance on the table after a win and we won’t give up after a loss.”", "Norwich began the match with an unfamiliar 4-4-2 formation, with Teemu Pukki in the unusual position of playing with a partner, Josip Drmic. They were on the front foot and in the opening two minutes forced a succession of free-kicks and corners, each taken by Emi Buendía with half-chances squandered by ponderous finishing, Drmic particularly culpable.", "That initial spell lasted for 15 minutes before Southampton began to exert themselves in midfield, the new club captain, James Ward-Prowse, forming an effective partnership with Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, the man he replaced. They closed down the supply to Norwich’s forward four. “We were physically stronger in the centre than the opponent and that was the key element of the day,” said Hasenhüttl.", "Norwich stalled, perhaps sensing that their opportunity had passed. Not for the first time this season, the mistakes then began to creep into their game. The first big chance came from a turnover; Todd Cantwell eased off the ball by Jack Stephens on halfway before the seas parted. The centre-half ran with the ball all the way into the penalty area before cueing up Ings, whose shot was well-judged but crashed back off the crossbar.", "Hasenhüttl claimed he did not have much to say at half-time. Surely the message was clear to his players that this game was there for the taking, however, and it was not long before his team pressed decisively on their hosts’ vulnerability. A ball into the Norwich box was not dealt with decisively, Armstrong poked possession to Ings on the edge of the box and the striker sized up his opportunity and finished with characteristic decisiveness, curling a shot beyond Tim Krul. Afterwards Ings, who looked as if he had never been in lockdown, said the game had been “good fun”.", "Southampton doubled their advantage in the 54th minute. Again it came from a turnover in the middle of the park, and again the visitors were able to advance straight down the pitch without interruption. This time it was Ings who was the enabler and he passed the ball to Armstrong on the edge of the box. After dancing past an ineffectual challenge he slotted a left-foot effort past Krul.", "Pukki then had his team’s two best chances but dithered and wasted both. With 11 minutes to go Southampton put the matter beyond doubt and again it was too easy, Ings releasing Michael Obafemi wide on the right.

Our performance was decent but it’s a setback.”", "He and Wilder have been on very different trajectories since winning promotion last spring and money is foremost among the assorted reasons why.

At this rate he risks looking on as one or more of Nuno and Frank Lampard oversee Champions League football, and it will take a masterful use of resources to tip the scales back in Spurs’ favour now.", "The frustration for Mourinho here was that after twice taking the lead his players could not hold on. Defensive errors of the type that handed Wolves the initiative are not made directly from the dugout, but perhaps he overthought his selection. Spurs are missing a wealth of quality and experience in attack and they were not helped when Hugo Lloris was ruled out before kick-off. So it seemed a risk to leave both Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, their best defenders, on the bench given the existing lack of leadership, and their replacements rarely looked at ease.", "“The result is totally unfair for us,” Mourinho said, but ultimately the better side won. He had selected a back three in which Davinson Sánchez and Japhet Tanganga were expected to deal with Wolves’ attacking pace, while Eric Dier stepped out to build attacks. For a while it worked and an assertive start brought a well-composed opener. Steven Bergwijn had nominally started on the right of a fluid front three but turned up in the No 10 position to feed Giovani Lo Celso. The Argentinian found Serge Aurier overlapping and, although Rui Patrício prevented Dele Alli from converting a fizzing cross, Bergwijn appeared in time to stab home the rebound.", "Wolves’ first equaliser reflected poorly on that rejigged backline. First Rúben Vinagre got the better of Aurier too easily, swiping over a cross that Dier stretched to clear but completely missed. Tanganga, taken unawares, could not prevent the ball rebounding off a knee and Matt Doherty had time to finish low past Paulo Gazzaniga.", "The away side, rarely flashy but always more than functional, were on top but Aurier struck the next blow before half-time. He had not scored a top-flight goal for two years and that did not seem likely to change when he cut inside Vinagre on to his weaker left foot. The position invited a shot, though, and Patrício was left standing by a rasping drive that would not have shamed Spurs’ absent forwards.", "If Alli, found alone in the box by a deep Ben Davies delivery, had not headed wide in the 55th minute then perhaps Mourinho would have been reflecting on a plan well executed. Instead he was left to bemoan that his side were “too good, too nice” in not doing the niggly things that can close out a game. Within two minutes of Alli’s miss Wolves had squared things up again through the outstanding Diogo Jota, who tapped in after Doherty and Raúl Jiménez had picked Tottenham’s left side apart. But his words chimed more strongly with the winner.", "It was a brilliant goal, Jota beating Lucas Moura with a flick inside his own half before travelling 40 yards and finding Jiménez open to his right. Jiménez, sleek and super-confident, checked inside Tanganga and finished emphatically but the outcome could have been avoided if Aurier had taken a booking and felled Jota as he broke upfield.", "“We were punished because we don’t have that aggression, that ruthlessness,” Mourinho said, making a contrast with an earlier tackle by Rúben Neves that had stopped a Moura counter in its tracks. They lacked those qualities in chasing the game, too; Troy Parrott was introduced only for stoppage time, to the crowd’s displeasure, but Mourinho reiterated his opinion that the 18-year-old is not ready for longer cameos.", "For Wolves, playing their 46th game of the season, there was no such hand-wringing. Nuno lauded his team’s powers of recovery after a first half he felt was below par. “We are relentless,” he said. “We believe the game is still to be played. The boys help each other in every action of every game.” That toughness is exactly what Mourinho must seek out.

But we couldn’t find our clarity in attack, we didn’t get the details right.”", "Bruce’s revamp facilitated Dwight Gayle’s lively return in attack, Joelinton’s relocation to a wide role and Miguel Almirón’s return to his preferred No 10 position.

He would probably have been celebrating them if, with just under 20 minutes to play, his side had been awarded a penalty after Jack O’Connell appeared to illegally halt a weaving run in from the right by Nicolas Pépé. The case was scrutinised by VAR after Mike Dean, refereeing his 500th Premier League game, opted not to penalise the defender and the decision taken at Stockley Park was the same.

The visitors had squandered an early chance to take the lead through Lys Mousset, and Granit Xhaka had cleared off the line from Oli McBurnie in the second half. But they had rarely cut Arsenal open, looking uncharacteristically skittish in possession, and Arteta was left to despair at the conception of Fleck’s goal. It came from a straightforward diagonal cross by the substitute Callum Robinson, which was duly flicked on by his fellow replacement Billy Sharp. Fleck, running on to the ball on the left side of the box, shaped his body perfectly to volley across Bernd Leno via a bounce and a snick off Ainsley Maitland-Niles.", "“It’s just one long ball, a second ball and then someone put it in the goal from an incredible angle,” Arteta lamented. “It’s difficult to control it.” But it was hardly a one-off in context and McBurnie could have made things much worse if Maitland-Niles had not blocked his late effort at the death.", "Defeat would have been hard on Arsenal, much as scrutiny of their weak resolve is appropriate. It would also have flattered United, who disappointed Wilder despite the outcome. “I don’t think a win for us would have been a deserved win,” he said. “I don’t think we were anywhere near our best today. The result is better than the performance.”", "Wilder’s frustration said plenty about the standards he has instilled, just as the draw his team salvaged spoke volumes for their redoubtable attitude.

Asked whether he expected to be in charge against Crystal Palace on Boxing Day, Pellegrini was diplomatic. “You never know, you never know,” he said. “I don’t think that your job depends on whether you win or you lose, I think it depends on the trust of the owners of the club and I’m absolutely sure that they trust in what we do, but I cannot answer that question.”", "After Haller scored he ran to celebrate with the substitute Issa Diop while his manager punched the air. “I don’t know exactly if the word is relief,” Pellegrini said. “I’m always talking with the players that we must play the same way we work every day of the week, we must try to be a solid team and score goals and I think we are able to do it better. We lost three important games at home, games which maybe are the difference between a very good season and a bad season that we are doing.”", "Festive cheer has been in short supply at West Ham but this victory may bring Pellegrini a slice of respite. Pellegrini had pointed to his team’s performance in victory at Chelsea a fortnight ago as evidence that his players retain faith in his methods and it was difficult to argue against that defence after an encouraging display here. Michael Antonio, who spent a season on loan at Southampton a decade ago, was outstanding up front alongside Haller, who returned to the starting lineup in place of Felipe Anderson, who was absent through illness. Haller would have doubled his and West Ham’s advantage in the second half but for a fine stop by Alex McCarthy and Antonio, who bullied Southampton’s backline throughout, had a goal ruled out by the video assistant referee, Jon Moss, after replays showed the forward handled in the buildup.", "Jan Bednarek and Jack Stephens never got to grips with Antonio. He displayed the kind of hunger that was lacking in Ralph Hasenhüttl’s side and, when Haller struck, it was no surprise that his partner proved the catalyst. Antonio burst beyond Bednarek before laying the ball off for Robert Snodgrass, whose sweeping first-time cross found Pablo Fornals at the back post. Fornals cushioned a header into the path of Haller, whose scruffy volley bounced in off McCarthy’s left post. “I think playing with Antonio works better for him, Antonio had a lot of pace and created space and movement,” Pellegrini said.", "Southampton head to Aston Villa, who are above them on goal difference, next weekend before visiting Chelsea five days later. The only notable downside for West Ham was the injury to David Martin late on. Pellegrini said his reserve goalkeeper sustained an almost identical hip-muscle injury to the one that has sidelined the No 1, Lukasz Fabianski, since the end of September. “Exactly the same [but] I hope not so big,” said Pellegrini, who confirmed doctors would assess the severity of the injury on Sunday.", "Southampton were painfully slow out of the blocks and ultimately punished for a slovenly performance.

The pace and incision of some of their football recalled the club’s glory days and Sir Alex Ferguson took it in from the stands with a wide smile.", "Never mind City’s push for back-to-back-to-back titles, United had merely wanted back-to-back league wins for the first time since March. They got that and, with Chelsea slipping up at Everton, they could reflect on having closed to within five points of the Champions League places.", "It was another occasion when United looked good against a high-flying rival, a continuation of the trend that has seen them beat Chelsea, Leicester and Spurs, and draw against Liverpool. Once again they did not have too much possession – the statistics showed their share to be only 28% – but it was what they did with it that counted – how they cut through City in the first half with what Solskjær described as “quick, attacking, flowing football”.", "Guardiola said his team had conceded four or five counter-attacks – no more – as he sought to play down what had happened. He was also entitled to point out that City had mustered 22 shots to United’s 11, although only five were on target compared with United’s six. City bristled with attacking menace, as they always do, only to routinely lack an end product.", "But they had no answers in defence to United for much of the first half and, as Guardiola ran the gamut of emotions in his technical area, Solskjær’s team threatened with every forward thrust. “We look like a Man United team,” Solskjær said. “That’s a big thing.”", "United created a fistful of chances in the opening 15 minutes, on the back of slick passing and movement in behind the City defence, and Guardiola could be happy that Ederson’s reflexes were on point. He saved from the excellent Dan James, stuck out a boot to deny Jesse Lingard in a one-on-one and plunged low to keep out an Anthony Martial shot.", "City had a few flickers in the early running, although United got bodies in the way, and a goal for the visitors came to feel increasingly likely. Rashford, inevitably, was at the heart of it, sparking panic inside the City area. City had few answers to his speed and directness and, on this occasion, Bernardo Silva simply crashed into him. There was no action in real time but, when the VAR checks began, it was apparent that it was a penalty. Rashford’s composure from the spot was pronounced.", "The breakthrough was the prompt for City to wobble and United to tighten their grip. Rashford fluffed a glorious chance after yet another rapid counter; he hit the crossbar following another and, when Martial added the second, it was too easy. Together with James, he played through City before beating Ederson at the near post.", "City rallied. Gabriel Jesus missed a gilt-edged diving header, David Silva could not convert a Kevin De Bruyne cross at the far post and Kyle Walker howled for a penalty when his low cross hit Fred’s hand as the United midfielder jumped in to block. “Next season it [VAR] will be better or we’ll be luckier,” Guardiola said.", "City pushed hard in the second half. Victor Lindelof blocked to deny De Bruyne, Aaron Wan-Bissaka got back to tackle Raheem Sterling and Rodri was denied by a David De Gea tip over. Although United retained a threat on the counter, it was City who came to look the likelier scorers of the next goal.

Jeffrey Schlupp’s goal was a beauty in itself. The Ghana international received the ball on the fringes of the Bournemouth half and drove at goal until there was nigh-on nowhere left to run. At that point his left foot took aim and powered a shot under Aaron Ramsdale.

The level of communication with the paying public, not to mention those physically involved in the match, was diabolical and it cannot be right that the pitch of confusion is heightening, rather than abating, nearly three months into the season.", "That was unlucky for Arsenal; no question. But they have papered over so many cracks in recent weeks and, from another angle, this simply felt like the universe calling time on their streak of escapes from the fire. For half an hour no such excitement had ever seemed likely.

Then, after a nonexistent half-hour from Palace, Wilfried Zaha woke up and decided to show why he thought Arsenal signed the wrong Ivory Coast winger. He might not have Pépé’s left foot but he had too much speed for Chambers, who clipped him in the box.

First Theo Walcott departed on a stretcher after being knocked out by taking the ball in the face, six minutes of treatment on the pitch having failed to bring him round. Walcott was taken to hospital before later being released. Then Ilkay Gündogan hit the bar while practically standing on the Everton goalline, Mahrez’s fierce cross reaching him too quickly to adjust his feet in time, and when Jordan Pickford made his second save of the afternoon from the industrious Mahrez barely five minutes of play had taken place.", "Once the contest settled down a little a well-worked Everton move ended with Sigurdsson seeing a shot blocked by Fernandinho, before City took the lead midway through the first half. Again Mahrez was involved, breaking down the right to set up Kevin De Bruyne for a cross, predictably sent early and accurately into the space right in front of Pickford where Gabriel Jesus twisted his body impressively to score with a close-range header.", "Sigurdsson brought a save from Ederson as Everton attempted to hit back but Mahrez tested Pickford again at the other end, putting his shot too close to the goalkeeper after bursting into space. When Everton did equalise after half an hour it was from an unexpected source, Séamus Coleman delicately lifting a shot over Nicolás Otamendi and Ederson from a narrow angle after the ball had broken free from Alex Iwobi. It was a shot, not a cross, and though Dominic Calvert-Lewin got a final touch on the line to claim the goal, the ball was going in anyway.", "City should have gone back in front just before the interval when a fine pass from Mahrez found Jesus in the clear but brought only a hesitant finish, the striker taking a touch to switch feet and ending up missing the target. There were chances for Gündogan and De Bruyne at the start of the second half and a decent one for Richarlison too, who headed wastefully from a Sigurdsson free-kick. The Brazilian sensibly left the next set-piece opportunity to Michael Keane and Yerry Mina, who combined to bring a first-class save from Ederson, clawing the ball out from under his crossbar.", "City produced a stunning opening on the hour when an exquisite through ball from Mahrez played Sterling in behind a square Everton defence, yet from close to the penalty spot with only Pickford to beat the winger slid his first-time shot the wrong side of an upright. The travelling support took up a chant of “Sergio, Sergio” almost immediately, and five minutes later the Argentinian was introduced, though it was Mahrez, whose performance deserved a goal, who made the breakthrough. City had a range of options when De Bruyne was fouled by Mina on the edge of the area, but Mahrez took the free-kick and cleared the wall with a shot that beat Pickford’s somewhat unconvincing dive.", "City were indebted to Ederson for keeping out Calvert-Lewin after Sigurdsson carved out a chance, though the home side’s search for an equaliser inevitably left gaps at the rear.", "After Mahrez had accelerated into one Sergio Agüero arrived at his shoulder to take over and drive across goal, where Sterling was able to fasten on to a rebound and steer the ball over the line.

His team were behind to a John McGinn goal and a man down after Ainsley Maitland-Niles’s careless red card. They had barely done a thing right but by the end they were celebrating a man who can do no wrong.", "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had already scored 13 goals in his last 11 club games so when he won and shaped to take a free-kick just outside the penalty area it was tempting, just for once, to make a prediction in a game involving Arsenal. They had just levelled the score for a second time, through Calum Chambers, and an atmosphere that had previously hummed with discontent was now crackling. The position looked set up for someone of his peerless finishing ability and so it proved, his whipped effort flying past Tom Heaton to send the Emirates delirious.", "“The character was amazing,” Emery said. “We want to feel something special with our supporters in the stadium, to connect with them and be strong in our mentality.”", "For 45 minutes none of those words were close to anyone’s lips, because Arsenal were catatonic. Their midfield of Mattéo Guendouzi, Granit Xhaka and Dani Ceballos may as well have been holograms for all the pressure they exerted on a Villa side that, while happy to test their hosts’ weaknesses, should not have posed an extraordinary threat. McGinn had already worked Bernd Leno twice when, escaping an inexplicably static Guendouzi, he nudged Anwar El Ghazi’s delivery past the Arsenal keeper and it sparked what appeared to be an unravelling.", "Maitland-Niles had missed a decent chance within two minutes and had also been guilty of standing off El Ghazi before the goal. He completed an unholy trinity when, having already been booked, he followed through on Neil Taylor.

His players had shown little discipline, a fact Sokratis Papastathopoulos underlined with a risible attempt to show Wesley had clipped him in the face. They rode out some early Villa pressure after the restart, though, and had begun to force a few hacked clearances when Guendouzi, a force of nature throughout the second period, thrust into the area and was fouled by Björn Engels. Aubameyang was happy to let Nicolas Pépé, who had looked like a player burdened both by a £72m price tag and the need for a goal, to take the penalty and it was duly dispatched.", "But Villa were back ahead within two minutes after Jack Grealish, leaving three Arsenal players trailing before crossing for Wesley to nick the ball home, produced a penetrative run of his own. Arsenal had shot themselves in the foot again and when Xhaka, a lightning rod for fans’ frustrations, was jeered upon his 72nd minute substitution there seemed little prospect of the clouds lifting.", "Nobody told that to Guendouzi, who struck a post and continued to drive forward furiously. When he clipped a deep ball towards Chambers, who had replaced Bukayo Saka, the otherwise impeccable Tyrone Mings attempted to cushion a header towards Taylor rather than making a simple clearance. Chambers was alert, intercepting and jabbing an impressive effort high into the net.", "Aubameyang then completed the turnaround and left the Villa manager, Dean Smith, ruing their inability to finish the game. “We paid them too much respect and tried to hang on to the lead,” he said, and it is true that Arsenal had looked there for the taking.", "“We lost a little bit of control, but we took a few risks to come back,” a far happier Emery said.

That, however, made it an even more painful occasion for the champions because, if there is one lesson to be had from last season, it is that a draw these days is a bad result for a team with title aspirations.", "This one ended a 15-match winning sequence, going back to January, and the spat between Guardiola and Agüero was probably a measure of their frustrations. It was not the first time the two have clashed and, for an uncomfortable amount of time, Guardiola could be seen flapping his arms and covering his mouth so nobody, bar Agüero, could make out the precise words. Suffice to say, it didn’t look like a “well done”.", "For Spurs, it was a tough, obdurate performance, albeit one that must have reminded them they are still a considerable distance behind City in terms of pure skill. Not that they should worry too much about that after ending a run of six successive away defeats. If that had extended to seven, it would have equalled their worst run since August to December 2000, when George Graham was in charge.", "To make matters worse for City, they could legitimately argue they ought to have been awarded a penalty in the first half because of Lamela’s manhandling of Rodri at a corner. The referee, Michael Oliver, evidently did not think a player being grappled to the floor was worthy of being penalised. Neither did the VAR officials, which was mysterious when this was precisely the sort of oversight they should be trying to put right.", "Amid all this controversy, it also now transpires that Sterling is capable of scoring the kind of expertly placed header that has never previously been listed among the skills of a player who stands at 5ft 6in. Though it helps when De Bruyne is capable of swinging over the kind of beautifully weighted delivery that led to the opening goal.", "The cross was sumptuous, spinning high in the air before arcing towards the back post. Sterling had turned his body position so when the ball connected with his forehead it went back across Lloris before nestling just inside the side-netting. It was placed to perfection. And, in that precise moment, the television cameras caught Guardiola looking at his coaching staff as if he was a little surprised, too.", "Their lead lasted three minutes before Lamela strode through the middle to place a left-footed shot past Ederson. Laporte had committed the classic defensive error of turning his back as his opponent shaped to shoot. Twenty yards out, Lamela curled a low effort into the bottom corner.", "City took the lead for a second time when Agüero darted forwards to turn in another of De Bruyne’s right-sided deliveries and, as a snapshot of how the game was going, how about the moment late in the first half when Bernardo was boxed in by three opponents but gave them all the slip? The olés were memorable as Bernardo eluded Tanguy Ndombele, Danny Rose and Lamela.", "The problem for City was turning their superiority into more goals and that left them vulnerable to the kind of sucker punch Moura delivered after his 55th-minute introduction for Harry Winks. Lamela swung over the corner from the right. Moura’s header flashed past Ederson and Spurs held on, courtesy of a correct, though late, VAR decision and more evidence of how the sport is changing."], "datePublished": "Sat 17 Aug 2019 19.41 BST"}, "_Norwich City_Newcastle United": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/17/norwich-newcastle-premier-league-match-report", "Home team": "Norwich City", "Away team": "Newcastle United", "Title": "Norwich brush aside Newcastle thanks to Teemu Pukki hat-trick", "Body": ["Teemu Pukki scored 29 league goals for Norwich in the Championship last season but he never got a hat-trick.

He set the tone by chasing 80 yards to help out his defence. He really embodies the spirit of the team. No one is thinking about themselves.”", "That dash from Pukki saw him charge back from the Newcastle box to disrupt a counterattack by toe-poking the ball from Joelinton. It was the Norwich player who looked like the £40m striker on this day, not Newcastle’s Brazilian, who put a decent headed chance over when the score was goalless and left the field injured in the second half, complaining of a hip injury.

I am not going to criticise individuals, to win a match or lose a match it’s about the team.”", "Norwich play Chelsea at home in their next match and that prospect will be exciting rather than daunting their supporters.

Craig Dawson had bundled carelessly into Alexandre Lacazette within 40 seconds but it took VAR almost three minutes to be confident of awarding the spot kick, which Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dispatched unfussily. Watford gathered themselves to press relentlessly, with Sarr in electric form on the right, and came close through Roberto Pereyra and Troy Deeney. But then Aubameyang teed up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager tearing a strip off his players despite Arsenal’s advantage.", "Aubameyang then controlled Tierney’s long throw and converted a masterful overhead kick that left him one goal short of the golden boot, an award he would have shared with Jamie Vardy if Ben Foster had not blocked one last chance near the end. Watford appeared done for but they persevered and, after David Luiz had produced another rash penalty-area challenge for the album on Welbeck, Deeney rammed in his own penalty before the break.", "Deeney, walking wounded for most of the season, hauled himself around the pitch and was in gladiator mode throughout. He would probably have gobbled up the chance Adam Masina missed early in the second period and further openings were spurned, too. Welbeck was thwarted for a first time by the excellent Martínez, who Arteta confirmed will start Saturday’s FA Cup final, and then had the entire Watford contingent pitchside on their feet upon converting a fizzing cross from Sarr.

One of these had Martial outmanoeuvring Fernandinho and cutting in from the left but a tame shot made easy work for Ederson.", "The goalkeeper, though, was about to commit his first howler. Fernandes won and took a free-kick on the left, after being kicked by Ilkay Gündogan. The German was then doubly at fault as he and Agüero allowed Martial to glide in and volley Fernandes’s dinked delivery. This went straight at Ederson yet in a butterfingers moment he allowed the ball to squeeze under his hands at the near post.", "City were now being punched open at will.

At the second-half’s start they found their range. Raheem Sterling slipped in Agüero and he finished but this was ruled offside.", "Ederson, though, still slumbered. A João Cancelo back-pass was mis-controlled and with Martial thundering in the keeper only just recovered.", "City claimed a corner on the right and from 25 yards Foden’s shot was tipped over for another from the same quadrant.

A victory with caveats too, to be sure: how Bernd Leno managed to emerge with a clean sheet is a question that will flummox the statisticians of the future. Indeed, for all their dominance Arsenal occasionally did their level best to make Newcastle look like a functional attacking side. Had Steve Bruce’s team been a little more clinical, particularly in the first 20 minutes when terms were still being negotiated, it might have been a different game entirely. By the time they threatened again, around an hour in, Arsenal were already 2-0 up through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Nicolas Pépé, and largely safe.", "Pépé was a treat to watch. It was his precise cross that set up Aubameyang’s opening goal, and his own strike three minutes later was fitting reward for a pleasingly decisive performance: sharp, unpredictable, productive.

He made the difference today.”", "As for Newcastle, there will be a few eyebrows raised at their late collapse, one in which their hard-won reputation for shape and solidity seemed to evaporate before our eyes. After a strong first half, they looked paralysed by caution in the second: consumed not by what they could get but by what they could get away with. The new wing-backs Valentino Lazaro and Danny Rose began well but looked dangerously exposed as the game went on. Bruce has staked his job and Newcastle’s survival on their ability to make things tough for the opposition. This, a meek and tired capitulation after a break of 12 days, did not bode well.", "And yet it was Newcastle who began this game by far the stronger: parrying Arsenal’s thrusts with ease, passing through the press, making the most of their infrequent spells of possession. With Miguel Almirón barracking his way up the right wing and Allan Saint-Maximin weaving his sorcery on the left, the early chances fell to the visitors. Lazaro had a shot blocked in the fifth minute. Sean Longstaff’s volley following an immaculately worked set-piece was almost deflected past a scrambling Leno. Joelinton stabbed just wide from six yards.", "But Arsenal finished the first half well, portending their clinical three‑minute burst near the start of the second. Eddie Nketiah, unexpectedly given the job of leading the line, began to find little pockets of space. On 53 minutes, Newcastle allowed Pépé plenty of time to pick a cross. Aubameyang placed his header well, sending it back across Martin Dubravka.", "Suitably relaxed, Arsenal loosened their ties and played a few shots. Pépé struck next, finishing from close range after an outrageous bit of skill from Bukayo Saka on the left. And though Newcastle briefly threatened to make the game interesting – Ciaran Clark missing from unmissable range, Saint-Maximin clattering the post – it was Arsenal who provided the final flourish. In the 90th minute, Lacazette squared for Özil. Perhaps through force of habit, Özil’s shot was more of a pass, a delicate lay-off that Dubravka could have trapped with his foot. Instead it bobbled out of his grasp and into the net.", "Lacazette brought the curtain down, smashing home Pépé’s cross after a lovely through ball from Joe Willock. Four-nil, and if there was any lingering surprise at full-time, it was not merely that Arsenal could still win at all, but that they could win like this.

We have a chance to recover second position.”", "For a while it looked like City would triumph here with the aid of VAR and over remarkable adversity, including self-inflicted wounds. Ederson was sent off in the 12th minute for clattering into Diogo Jota outside his area, then Raheem Sterling had the same contentiously awarded penalty saved twice by Rui Patrício. Yet still 10-man City established a two-goal lead. First Sterling rolled in the rebound from his retaken penalty, then he scored in the second half to move tantalisingly close to victory.", "But not close enough. Wolves, again inspired by the phenomenal Adama Traoré, came storming back with three exquisite goals in the last 35 minutes. Traoré scored the first of them before creating an equaliser for Raúl Jiménez, who later played a beautiful pass to tee up Matt Doherty for a winning goal that ignited wild celebrations at Molineux. And, no doubt, on Merseyside.", "Guardiola’s plans ran into a complication even before kick-off here, as illness afflicted Gabriel Jesus and forced City to draft in Sergio Agüero. An aristocrat’s problem if ever there was one, but City had wanted to ease their record goalscorer back into action after a thigh injury and would have preferred not to make this the match in which he made his first start for over two months.", "As it turned out, Agüero was invited to rest up again after only 12 minutes, as Guardiola had to sacrifice him to introduce a replacement goalkeeper following the dismissal of Ederson. The referee, Martin Atkinson, ordered the keeper off after he charged out of his box and brought down Jota, who beat him to a pass over the top by Conor Coady. In came Claudio Bravo for his first Premier League appearance since November’s defeat at Liverpool. João Moutinho’s free-kick made for a comfortable reintroduction. Neither manager grumbled about the red card, nor would they offer their views on what happened in the 22nd minute – but the home crowd were not coy about expressing their anger at the decision to award City a penalty when Riyad Mahrez fell spectacularly in the box following contact with Leander Dendoncker. The infringement was not apparent to most people in the stadium but this is the age of mass surveillance: VAR spotted Dendoncker treading on the Algerian’s foot.", "Patrício saved Sterling’s penalty but then, again on the recommendation of VAR, the referee ordered it to be retaken due to encroachment. Patrício made another save but was helpless to stop the relieved Sterling from stroking in the rebound. A few bozos in the stands vented their anger by flinging objects on to the pitch. The Football Association has opened an investigation.", "City did well to protect their lead until half-time. Guardiola replaced Mahrez during the break with 18-year-old Eric Garcia as City buttressed their defence. Wolves soon showed the tempo that the youngster would have to get used to, as Jiménez and Jota cut through City’s backline with wicked finesse. Jota flicked the ball over the bar after running on to the Mexican’s lovely looped pass.", "Soon Sterling produced an even finer chip. After being released by Kevin De Bruyne, Sterling ran into the box and did what he had been unable to do from the penalty spot, beating Patrício with a deadly dink.", "That gave City an extra cushion but they could not sit comfortably for long. Five minutes later Sterling lost possession in midfield to Rúben Neves, who helped the ball on to Traoré, whose devastating directness City have learned to dread. After scoring twice at the Etihad, he slashed City’s lead here by ramming a long-range shot into the bottom corner.", "Wolves attacked in waves after that. Traoré almost found a way through them again but was foiled by Bravo. City enjoyed a let-off as Romain Saïss nodded wide from six yards. Then Rodri made a critical intervention at the back post to deny Doherty.", "As City clung on, Benjamin Mendy tried to shepherd the ball out of play near the byline, a decision that Traoré soon made him regret. The Spaniard shunted the defender aside before crossing for Jiménez to slide the ball into the net from close range. Doherty then struck a superb winning goal, running in from the right and exchanging slick passes with Jiménez before firing into the net.", "In the dying seconds Sterling struck a free-kick against the crossbar.

It is no surprise that the notion, never entirely convincing given Liverpool’s steely excellence, of another title-winning fairytale has come to seem too far-fetched but they might have expected the dream to perpetuate for at least another week. Instead their winning run was halted by a Norwich side who completely deserved their draw and arguably had the better opportunities to win, retaining a threat even when Leicester found some sort of stride after half-time.", "Norwich had taken the lead through Teemu Pukki’s latest ice-cool finish and, in a strange way, even the manner of the home side’s equaliser spoke to their afternoon’s frustration. Jamie Vardy had scored in eight consecutive league games, a burst of form in line with that streak of Leicester victories, and thought he had made it nine when he met James Maddison’s corner and saw his header flash into the net via Tim Krul’s hand. But the Norwich keeper had actually made the crucial touch, diverting the ball goalwards when it had been heading wide, and Vardy’s hopes of nearing his 11-game record from 2015-16 disappeared despite a number of subsequent efforts.", "“It’s not something we’ve ever spoken about,” Brendan Rodgers said when asked about the receding prospect of challenging Liverpool, now 10 points clear, for first place. “I think everyone else has. The players have been brilliant; it says everything that we’ve drawn a game and everyone’s disappointed. We weren’t quite at our level today but we’ve still managed to get a point.”", "They were so far short in the first half that by the interval Rodgers had ripped up his gameplan and turned a narrow 4-3-1-2 formation into a 4-3-3. Norwich were much the better side over the first half-hour, once they had got over an early scare in which Krul fumbled Youri Tielemans’ shot against an upright, and they should have scored when Pukki could not quite make decisive contact with Max Aarons’ delivery after a slick move had sliced Leicester open.", "Pukki did get it right in the 26th minute although Rodgers will have been perplexed by the way a simple pass from Tom Trybull cut through their entire midfield, giving Emi Buendía all the space he needed in front of the back four. His slide-rule ball for Pukki was a peach, weighted just well enough to meet the striker’s run past Caglar Soyuncu. The finish, rolled across a rooted Kasper Schmeichel, was customarily outstanding.", "It turned out Pukki, who could have scored a winner in the dying minutes had Soyuncu and Ricardo Pereira not made last-ditch challenges when he twice got away, finished the game nursing a broken toe. “He’s from Finland so I’m not too concerned,” said Daniel Farke, who does not expect Pukki to miss any matches and cannot afford him to. Pukki has nine Premier League goals this season and it is hardly outlandish to suggest his smart runs and precise shooting may be the difference between relegation and a successful campaign.", "Norwich may need him less if they could kick their habit of undoing so much work with maddeningly simple concessions. Maddison, their former player, may be an outstanding operator at set-plays but his delivery and Vardy’s peeled run were hardly intricate stuff and at that point it seemed Leicester would clear their heads and push on. Immediately after the equaliser Rodgers replaced Kelechi Iheanacho, abruptly ending the forward’s mini-renaissance, and introduced Demarai Gray. Being hauled off in the first half is never a good look and Rodgers insisted it was a tactical move, to facilitate the formation switch, rather than a response to a flashpoint that occurred shortly before Vardy scored.", "Norwich felt entitled to receive the ball back when Tom Trybull, aware Buendía was down, knocked it out for a Leicester throw-in. But Iheanacho, failing to get the memo on receiving possession, surged towards the penalty area and was halted only by Christoph Zimmermann’s foul.", "Now that the danger had passed, half of Norwich’s players piled in furiously on Iheanacho. The mêlée took some resolving, with VAR eventually being deployed to adjudge that Todd Cantwell, who had bent down menacingly towards his prone opponent and appeared to grab at him, did not deserve a red card. Both managers agreed Iheanacho had, as Rodgers said, “totally misread the situation” and it arguably had the effect of stalling Norwich’s dominance.", "Vardy hit an upright from the tightest of angles early in the second period but, after threatening to build up a head of steam, Leicester never created enough. They found Norwich resolute, with Ben Godfrey imperious at the back, and Farke could bask in what he felt was their best performance of the season. In his opinion Norwich need to show the initiative of “hoover salesmen” in their fight to stay up and this, he said, counted as one successful transaction.", "For Leicester, successive league meetings with Manchester City and Liverpool are now less potential title showdowns than opportunities to assert their top-four credentials. “Perhaps Jürgen [Klopp] has already sent me a message, I’ll check my phone later,” Farke said.

The Scot has some scriptwriter.", "Chelsea were beaten by emotion, fight and character on Ferguson’s big day. Frank Lampard’s team played well but defended poorly. They were also up against a formidable obstacle in the form of an Everton team that, to a man, gave everything for the nervous mountain of energy standing in the technical area. Well, not standing exactly. Everton’s temporary manager played every ball, raced down the touchline when the goals went in and hugged ball boys as he whipped Goodison Park into the frenzied bearpit that makes this place so special. It was a throwback game and all the better for it.", "“I’d have hugged the linesman, too, if he was there,” said a relieved and delighted Ferguson. “It is just emotion, just such adrenaline. When you see the kids’ faces, I think one of them was in tears and I was in tears to be honest. It was one game and no one can ever take it away from me, can they? But the players were unbelievable and it is their day.”", "Niko Kovac was in the crowd - part of a fact-finding exercise on English football, according to his agent - and, if Everton wanted to sell themselves to the former Bayern Munich manager, they could not have delivered a better presentation. Only five minutes had gone when Richarlison gave the home side the lead and the belief they desperately needed after three consecutive defeats. The first goal of the former Everton centre-forward’s temporary reign just had to be a header.", "Richarlison started like a man possessed, not one dwelling on the departure of the manager who signed him twice and helped make him a Brazil international. He released Djibril Sidibé down the right and set off into the heart of the Chelsea penalty area in anticipation of a cross. The France international delivered to perfection and Richarlison rose above the Chelsea defence to score with a powerful header. Ferguson sprinted halfway down the touchline in celebration, returning to his technical area with several fist-pumps to the crowd and the directors’ box.", "There was nothing pretty about the home side’s display – their 37 tackles were the most made by an Everton team in a Premier League game this decade – but players such as the maligned Morgan Schneiderlin, Theo Walcott and Gylfi Sigurdsson were relentless, their commitment to the cause faultless. Lampard lamented his side’s failure to match the hosts physically.", "Ferguson went for a 4-4-2 formation and Jordan Pickford was under instruction to launch the ball at every opportunity. Chelsea created a host of good openings in the first half but over-elaboration in the area, such as when Michael Keane played a stray clearance straight to Tammy Abraham, and the willingness of Everton defenders to put their bodies on the line ensured Pickford did not have a save to make before the break. They were two down when Everton made another stirring start to the second half.", "The highly impressive Dominic Calvert-Lewin prospered from a mistake and a slice of misfortune by Kurt Zouma, the defender who spent last season on loan at Everton and whom Silva desperately wanted to re-sign in the summer. Zouma miscued a clearance on the edge of his area, allowing Calvert-Lewin to beat Andreas Christensen in an aerial challenge. The striker’s header bounced off Zouma and back into his path in front of goal. Kepa Arrizabalaga was beaten by a fine finish into the bottom corner and Goodison erupted. Ferguson’s celebration on this occasion involved picking up the nearest ball boy and swinging him around in circles.", "Chelsea’s response was immediate. The visitors weaved their way down the left with César Azpilicueta. Lucas Digne cleared his cross with a sliding challenge but it was returned emphatically by Mateo Kovacic, who drilled an outstanding first-time shot into Pickford’s bottom corner from distance.", "The visitors laid siege to the Everton goal. Pickford tipped over from Azpilicueta, several defenders took heavy blows but battled on until, in Digne’s case, they could run no more. And just as Goodison braced itself for another late blow, having suffered so many this season, Everton scrambled home a third after Walcott pounced on a poor clearance by Arrizabalaga.

Yet again one wondered where exactly they would be without Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who equalised twice, and the overriding sense is that half a team of new players would probably make more difference than whoever the next manager might be.", "Given Ljungberg has no idea whether he will be in charge of the squad for six days, six weeks or six months, there is little he can currently do about its composition. But he will have to find a way to extract a measure of consistency because, in common with a huge chunk of this season’s outings under Emery, Arsenal produced a match of dizzyingly different microclimates. This one broadly brought a sunny first 30 minutes, a tepid second and a tempestuous third; somehow they need to get an extended hold of games and it was no surprise when Ljungberg referred afterwards to their glaring achilles heel when possession is lost.", "Norwich frequently enjoyed themselves when that occurred and both of their goals, through Teemu Pukki and the outstanding Todd Cantwell, came when Arsenal were largely caught up the pitch. While the visitors’ failings would fill a tome it is important to reflect the quality of Daniel Farke’s home side, who might be over the hump of the injury crisis that blighted their autumn and should be equipped to give survival at least a go. They were furious at the circumstances of Aubameyang’s first goal, for which he was given a second opportunity from the penalty spot after encroachment by Max Aarons, but gathered themselves impressively and by the end they came close to running Arsenal into the ground.", "Early on it was Ljungberg’s charges who performed with that kind of verve. They were smartly out the blocks and could have scored twice within the first 10 minutes, Tim Krul just about stopping Alexandre Lacazette’s shot bobbling in and then thanking Onel Hernández for a goalline clearance after Shkodran Mustafi had reached a corner first. The introduction of Mustafi, who was ushered towards the exit door by Emery but played his first Premier League game of the season here, was one of a few tweaks from Ljungberg. There were also places in midfield for Joe Willock and Granit Xhaka, the latter’s reintroduction to the fold over the past four days having caused barely a ripple due to the furore over Emery, but that hardly amounted to open-heart surgery on the team.", "Norwich’s opener suggested that is exactly what Arsenal need. They had hardly entered the visitors’ half when Pukki found an innocuous-looking pocket of space and saw Mustafi and David Luiz back off him to the extent that it made sense to have a crack. The ball ricocheted off Mustafi and past a helpless Leno, but the centre-back would have had no poor luck to lament had he put pressure on Pukki in the first place.", "Soon enough Ljungberg would get the slice of fortune every budding manager needs. The referee, Paul Tierney, was right to award Arsenal a spot-kick for handball by Christoph Zimmermann, even if it took VAR some time to confirm the decision. Krul, diving to his right, saved a poor effort from Aubameyang and a boisterous Carrow Road neared fever pitch.", "But those cheers became howls of derision when a new check revealed that Aarons, who had cleared Norwich’s lines after the save and wasthus deemed active, had encroached before the kick was taken. Aubameyang made no mistake the second time. The whole sequence had dragged on more than five minutes and, though it had all been played by the book, Norwich and Farke were rightly frustrated that the interpretation of football’s rules currently seems to change by the week.", "They dusted themselves down and led at the interval when Cantwell, teed up by a marauding Hernández, took advantage of a lukewarm pursuit by Xhaka to finish beautifully. Ljungberg’s team-talking gifts would be tested at the first stroke but Arsenal re-emerged with purpose and Aubameyang finished emphatically after Mustafi’s volley had been blocked.", "A top team would probably have pushed on from there. Instead Norwich, their mentality seemingly bulletproof, went again and Kenny McLean will still be wondering how Leno tipped his shot wide after the pair went face to face. Cantwell missed by a whisker and Leno pulled off more crucial saves from Pukki, a McLean free-kick and a last-gasp effort from Sam Byram. In a rare Arsenal sortie Ibrahim Amadou blocked from Lucas Torreira; it was simply relief from a storm of Norwich attacks at that stage, though, and Ljungberg knows now that there will be no easy path into calmer waters."], "datePublished": "Sun 1 Dec 2019 16.09 GMT"}, "_Chelsea_West Ham United": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/30/chelsea-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report", "Home team": "Chelsea", "Away team": "West Ham United", "Title": "Cresswell eases pressure on Pellegrini as West Ham sink weary Chelsea", "Body": ["At the end of this victory West Ham’s players ran across the turf to hug their goalkeeper David Martin.

Villa would have won by an even higher margin if not for Newcastle’s goalkeeper, Martin Dúbravka, and some scruffy finishing.", "Villa had been vulnerable to counterattacks in their previous match, a defeat at Wolves, and Newcastle troubled them with one in the third minute. Joelinton led the charge before the chronically wayward Miguel Almirón finished in all-too-familiar style, wafting a shot way off target from 20 yards.", "Newcastle did not threaten again until just before the break, by which time they were 2-0 down. “What was disappointing was that we were too passive with the ball and without, especially in the first half,” said Bruce.", "Villa, by contrast, were vibrant, continually probing as they dominated possession. Newcastle initially defended well and it took a moment of delicious subtlety from Jack Grealish to create the first opening, the forward dummying a pass by John McGinn into the path of Matt Targett, whose probing low cross from the left practically pleaded with a forward to tap it home. El Ghazi did not react sharply enough to do so.", "Villa’s relentless passing eventually worked chinks in the visitors’ defence. Douglas Luiz forced a fine save from Dúbravka with a wicked curling shot from 20 yards on the half-hour after a tee-up by Grealish.", "One minute later the goalkeeper had to pick the ball out of his net after DeAndre Yedlin barged into Grealish at the edge of the area. Hourihane rolled the free-kick short to Grealish in order to improve the shooting angle and then curled a wonderful shot around the wall and in at the near post.", "Four minutes later Grealish won another free-kick. Hourihane, owner of a cultured left foot, sent a gorgeous ball across the face of Newcastle’s goal and El Ghazi – perfectly alert this time – gave his markers the slip to finish from inside the six-yard box.", "Heaton made sure Villa got to the interval with their two-goal lead intact, turning a header by Federico Fernández over the bar after a corner.", "Newcastle briefly hinted at a comeback at the start of the second half but Tom Heaton tipped a fine shot by Allan Saint-Maxim round the post.", "For a while Villa became jittery but they still created the better chances, with Wesley twice denied from close range by Dúbravka.", "Bruce replaced one of his three centre-backs with Andy Carroll and switched to a 4-4-2 formation.

They started the day at the foot of the table and without an away goal in the Premier League since the opening night of the season at Anfield. It never showed. Norwich were bright and adventurous from the start, strong and resilient when Everton applied late pressure and departed with their first away win of the campaign courtesy of Todd Cantwell’s polished finish and substitute Srbeny’s late strike. Victory was richly deserved over a weak, laboured and clueless Everton team who are now four points off the relegation places with Leicester, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United up next.", "Silva’s hold on his job looks precarious in the extreme. His treatment from the home crowd left the watching Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s major shareholder, and the chairman, Bill Kenwright, in no doubt as to the lack of faith and belief in the manager’s methods, or ability to galvanise a passionless group of players. “It is not the moment to talk about individual positions,” was Silva’s response to whether he expected to remain Everton’s manager. “I have to respect the feelings of the fans. It is not the first time. We didn’t play well enough to win. There was no intensity and not enough pace or mobility to disorganise them.” He had talks after the game with Moshiri and Marcel Brands, the director of football.", "Jordan Pickford was the busier goalkeeper throughout as the marauding Onel Hernández and Norwich’s sharp, crisp passing, plus their ability to bully Everton’s defenders, exposed the home side’s soft underbelly. Sam Byram, Kenny McLean and Hernández all tested the England international before he produced a superb stop to prevent the Cuban winger breaking the deadlock. McLean released Hernández clear of a static rearguard and, with Yerry Mina desperately trying to close him down, drove hard and low towards the bottom corner. Pickford reacted expertly to save low to his right and Djibril Sidibé, one of several outfield players to struggle in royal blue, headed the rebound to safety.", "Urgency and intensity made their belated appearance in the Everton display at the start of the second half but Norwich responded with resilience and determination. Ben Godfrey epitomised both qualities in the heart of the visitors’ defence, throwing himself in the way of a goal-bound shot by Cenk Tosun and commanding his area impressively alongside Christoph Zimmermann. The availability of two fit central defenders for Farke, for the first time in months, made a telling difference. The long wait for a Premier League away goal and a merited lead ended when Everton were undone by weak defending and Norwich’s quicker reactions.", "Zimmermann started the move with a long ball out of defence that was headed into the path of Teemu Pukki. Mason Holgate and Mina closed in on the Norwich striker but he was too strong for both, and worked the ball into the chasm left by Everton’s central defenders. Cantwell was the first to spot the opportunity and seized it brilliantly, bursting through the middle before beating Pickford with a low, measured finish inside the near post.", "Everton stirred only for Tim Krul to deny the otherwise anonymous Gylfi Sigurdsson plus Tosun and Tom Davies.

This was even more galling for Solskjær given it was Joshua King, the Bournemouth striker once a pupil of his in United’s reserves, who inflicted this latest wound. In finishing drills after training, King opened his ears trying to perfect the killer instinct synonymous with Solskjær’s playing days.", "For United, any feelgood factor fostered over the past fortnight has quickly diminished. The raw and painful reality is they have tasted victory in the league only once since September and Solskjær acknowledged they must improve if they are to give themselves any chance of qualifying for the Champions League. “We need a response because games like this you need to win if you want to challenge for top four and we’re disappointed,” the manager said.", "“It’s a test of character when you come down to places like this; 1-0 down, half-time. In the second half, at least we went for it. We didn’t stop trying but it was the lack of quality that couldn’t give us the point or three. Two more games before the international break – we’ve got a chance on Thursday to qualify [for the Europa League knockout stage] and then Brighton at home.”", "On this evidence, United are going nowhere fast and that Solskjær is already dissecting their deficiencies in the race for the top four highlights the challenges ahead. By contrast, for Bournemouth this was almost the complete performance; Nathan Aké and Steve Cook were immense in defence, Jefferson Lerma a ubiquitous presence in midfield and King and Callum Wilson pests United simply could not control in attack. Aaron Ramsdale, the England Under-21 goalkeeper who spent last season earning his stripes at AFC Wimbledon, was again unflappable.", "However, as Solskjær conceded, it was King who ultimately made the difference. “He’s always a threat, he’s strong and when you win the game with a moment of magic like that you say ‘well done,’” he said. “He’s developed into a very good player.”", "Daniel James pierced holes in Bournemouth’s backline early on, supplying Andreas Pereira and Fred, both of whom ended up aquaplaning on a saturated surface, but it was King’s goal that illuminated an entertaining first half. The striker chested Adam Smith’s dinked cross before juggling the ball away from a statuesque Victor Lindelöf and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who allowed the striker to swivel unchallenged and lash the ball home on the volley. It was an emphatic finish but another instance of powder-puff defending, not long after Wan-Bissaka got away with allowing King to tee up Ryan Fraser to test David de Gea.", "“I’m sure that will be a special moment for him,” said the Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe. “When you play against your former clubs, it can have extra meaning. We felt we needed that win for our own confidence and impetus into our season.”", "Solskjær felt the international break reinvigorated his squad but, after going behind here, his side surrendered all tempo and they struggled to hurt the hosts until the substitute Mason Greenwood rattled a post eight minutes from time.

It was not a pretty game, United dragged Liverpool down from their lofty recent standards and with five minutes to go, the league leaders looked out of ideas.

What a moment it was for Lallana, whose Liverpool career has been blighted by injury. It was his first goal since he scored in a 3-0 Anfield win over Middlesbrough in May 2017 and it was the prompt for United’s nerves to jangle.", "Liverpool had been poor in the first half and better in the second, but without creating too much of clear-cut note.

Solskjær’s idea was to hit his pacy forwards, Rashford and Daniel James, with balls into the channels but also for them to defend from the front; to set the tone for the team. They did so. This was arguably Rashford’s best performance under Solskjær while James’s energy and remorselessness was a positive.

United still had some way to go but when Scott McTominay released James, there was pace and possibility. The Welshman crossed low and, after deceiving Joël Matip with a clever piece of movement inside the area, Rashford prodded past Alisson.", "Klopp’s argument was that the referee Martin Atkinson had allowed the play to continue because he knew that VAR would help him after the event.

They lacked creativity again, bolstering the argument that they need attacking reinforcements before the transfer window closes, and paid for their carelessness when Martinelli, an 18-year-old winger with a wonderfully direct style, hauled Arsenal level with a stunning solo goal just after the hour.", "Chelsea’s imprecision is hurting their push for Champions League qualification – fifth-placed Manchester United will go three points behind them if they beat Burnley at home on Wednesday – and it spoke volumes that they were incapable of holding on after César Azipilicueta restored their lead with six minutes left. Lampard’s side are too loose and Kepa Arrizabalaga’s indifferent form was captured by the moment when Héctor Bellerín, cutting on to his left foot, rescued a point for Arsenal with a shot that somehow squirmed beyond Chelsea’s goalkeeper.", "Arrizabalaga has conceded too many soft goals this season but Arteta was entitled to argue Arsenal merited a draw after a show of defiance in the second half. His side stood up to be counted after Mustafi’s disastrous error led to David Luiz’s red card on 26 minutes. Granit Xhaka excelled as a makeshift centre-half, Martinelli ran Azpilicueta ragged on the left and Arteta, who has lost only one of his seven games, was delighted with his new side’s spirit on a ground where they have suffered in the past.", "Initially David Luiz was the story against his old side. There was no respectful celebration from the Brazilian when he scored here for Paris Saint-Germain in a Champions League tie in 2015 and he looked to make his presence felt from the start, attracting the ire of the Chelsea fans when he charged into the back of Tammy Abraham and kneed the striker up the backside. Battle lines had been drawn.", "Abraham would have the last laugh, though David Luiz’s dismissal owed much to the brainlessness of Mustafi. While there have been signs of progress under Arteta, the fact remains the Spaniard has inherited a squad containing a multitude of weaknesses. There is only so much Arteta can improve with his work on the training ground and that was underlined by Mustafi’s blunder.", "After a promising opening Chelsea simply had to wait for Arsenal’s most unreliable player to self-destruct. Abraham had fooled Mustafi with a clever turn before scoring his side’s late winner at the Emirates last month and this time he was in the right place when the centre-half sold Bernd Leno horribly short with a staggeringly incompetent back-pass. Abraham raced away, rounded Leno and went down following a desperate lunge from David Luiz.", "Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot and how the Chelsea fans chortled when they saw the referee reaching for his red card. David Luiz had denied Abraham a clear goalscoring opportunity and he departed with mocking chants ringing in his ears. All that was left was for Jorginho to tuck his penalty away, giving Chelsea a lead their enterprising football deserved.", "Yet Lampard, who hopes to beat Atlético Madrid to the signing of PSG’s Edinson Cavani, would despair at Chelsea’s inability to kill the game. While Callum Hudson-Odoi tested Leno with a rasping drive, they struggled to make the most of their numerical advantage. They lost their shape in midfield, where N’Golo Kanté had a disappointing game, and allowed Arsenal’s belief to grow.", "The hosts flirted with disaster early in the second half, Arrizabalga almost playing Jorginho into trouble. Chelsea’s game management was dismal and Arsenal, who looked blunt at first without the suspended Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, equalised in the 63rd minute. A Chelsea corner was cleared, Martinelli took possession in his own half, outpaced Emerson, raced clear after a slip from Kanté and slipped the ball past Arrizabalaga.", "Lampard turned away in disgust. Chelsea are an infuriating side and they did not convince even after Azpilicueta turned Hudson-Odoi’s cross past Leno. Arsenal fought and Lampard struggled to understand why his players turned down opportunities to put the ball out of play when Abraham went down with an ankle injury.

Bournemouth’s belief, as Howe acknowledged, was shot by Abdoulaye Doucouré’s strike three minutes before the interval but they were short of urgency throughout, while Watford, masterfully led and spearheaded by their tenacious captain, Troy Deeney, seemed almost superhuman as they strutted around.", "“Confidence is such an important thing to any team and it just felt it was lacking from that goal onwards, it seemed to dent us,” Howe said. “That’s been chipped away at and that’s my biggest challenge, to refind that. We can only regroup, learn from what we’ve delivered, analyse the game properly and improve. We need to rediscover our belief in the team, for me that’s the only thing missing because we’ve got good players. With the run we’ve been on, it’s damaged us a little bit and I think that’s the big challenge we face. I don’t doubt the players’ quality because they’ve proved and delivered it before.”", "Watford supporters serenaded a boisterous performance from start to finish but Pearson was reluctant to overindulge in a victory, which extends their unbeaten run to five matches. “It’s not a season-changing result but it is an important one, especially in the context of our own situation,” Pearson said. “There are so many games left I think it would be foolish to think that just because we have got out of the bottom three that the job is done. There is an awful long way to go. But it quantifies the work the players have put in.”", "Pearson played down the magnitude of this match, but Howe described this encounter as the start of a season-defining period, with their next three matches against Norwich, Brighton and Aston Villa, all of whom are endangered at the foot of the table. Bournemouth failed to hurt Watford, who seized on a poor clearance by Mark Travers to open the scoring through Doucouré.

Meanwhile, Ramsdale, who was absent with a minor hamstring injury, was stationed in the Steve Fletcher Stand, doing his best to gee up supporters but there was little to stimulate the home crowd. A once free-scoring Bournemouth have gone eerily cold in attack – they have conceded nine goals without reply in their last three matches – and for Dominic Solanke the barren runs goes on, with this another fruitless league appearance, his 28th without finding the net.", "Sarr was disappointed to be withdrawn eight minutes from time, with Pearson quick to pacify the winger but, in reality, the damage had already been done. Everything seemed to click for Watford, even down to Pearson’s game management, notably his trio of late changes, which were agonising from Bournemouth’s point of view. The visitors siphoned each last trickle of vim out of the hosts, powerless as they slumped to a third successive league defeat.", "“We talked very early on about the fact that we would have to have a substantial run at some point,” Pearson said. “We are having a good run at the moment but I am not naive enough to think these things carry on indefinitely without working at it.

The transformation of an ageing team has been propelled by homegrown youngsters, and a potentially tricky trip to Turf Moor became a sweet affair for the 21-year-old from Hershey, Pennsylvania. Pulisic’s first Chelsea goals were a perfect hat-trick, in more ways than one, scored with his left foot, his right and his head, capping a stunning display. It offered ample evidence of why Chelsea paid £58m for him and brought the rare sound of their fans chorusing: “USA, USA.”", "“I am absolutely delighted for him,” Lampard said. “It was a fantastic match-winning appearance. He showed the full package. There has been a lot of talk around Christian for the big price tag. He is quite rightly a star in his own country. I know the back story and the pressure of the move. He [only] had a week’s break in the summer, so why am I going to throw him in?”", "Pulisic has had to be patient – “I didn’t think it was going to be super easy,” he said – but after a frustrating two months, when the American has been a bit-part player and has not even made the bench at times, this was an explosion of excellence. Pulisic has been overshadowed by Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham but, on his first league start since August, he upstaged them, taking the striker’s record as Chelsea’s youngest hat-trick scorer in the Premier League. A first treble of his senior career came as such a surprise to the scorer that he forgot to claim the match ball. His teammates duly collected and signed it. It was the least they could do.", "Rewarded for his catalytic cameo against Ajax, when he set up Michy Batshuayi’s winner, Pulisic made the most of his promotion. His opener was all of his own making. In different ways, he exposed three of the Burnley back four. He caught Matt Lowton dawdling in possession and surged away. He had the skill to dart past James Tarkowski and his angled shot went through Ben Mee’s legs.", "Burnley were complicit in their own downfall and if Mee was luckless that Pulisic’s second deflected in off him, Tarkowski had given the ball away to Willian, who sent the American powering into space. “The second goal is a killer,” lamented Sean Dyche. “But you can’t give away the chances we did tonight.”", "Pulisic’s third came with a glancing header from Mount’s cross. “Back in my youth days I scored a few headers, but professionally, no,” said a surprised scorer.", "Willian drilled in the fourth from Abraham’s pass. “Our midfield combinations and movement were beautiful to watch,” said Lampard. “There were so many great things to admire.”", "His detractors could point out that the unloved Maurizio Sarri oversaw a four-goal victory at Turf Moor and that the Italian did so with a clean sheet. Yet this was emphatic and exhilarating, ambitious and auspicious. “It is a fun team to play with now,” Pulisic said.", "The luckless Lowton was tormented while the demoted Callum Hudson-Odoi produced the wrong answer. The substitute’s brief appearance was notable for the award of a penalty, which was reversed by VAR, with replays proving that, far from being fouled by Tarkowski, the winger had dived. “Young players are the future of the game,” added Dyche. “If they are diving now, we have massive trouble in five or 10 years’ time.”", "His own side had a different set of difficulties, even if some were alleviated by a spirited comeback. Jay Rodriguez’s spectacular goal represented a belated first top-flight strike at Turf Moor for his hometown club while Dwight McNeil, who troubled César Azpilicueta, got the goal his excellence merited.

They understand where we are and they haven’t shirked responsibility. We haven’t eradicated the threat of relegation. What we’ve produced recently is good, but that’s the baseline.”", "For Mourinho, whose team came closest to scoring when a poked Erik Lamela effort was cleared off the line by the smallest of margins in stoppage time, his team had been good too.

It’s the kind of game when you have a guy who smells goals, probably you win it. It’s injuries, it’s the Christian [Eriksen] situation. We have our problems but in the game today, and against Liverpool, we showed good things, especially this organisation, this commitment. I am happy with lots of things we did.”", "The truth was that Spurs started well, without causing Ben Foster any real moments of concern. By the half- hour, however, Watford were on top and during the first 15 minutes of the second half should have taken the lead.", "Their penalty came in the 69th minute, the result of incessant pressure that culminated in Jan Vertonghen desperately blocking a shot from Gerard Deulofeu with his arm. Deeney stepped up to take it, but his shot was soft and too close to Paolo Gazzaniga’s right hand. It was Deeney’s third miss in his past six Premier League penalties.", "The spot kick inspired Mourinho to intervene, introducing Eriksen into the fray for perhaps his last Spurs appearance as well as new loan signing Gedson Fernandes. This had some small effect, but no real opportunities until the very last.", "In added time a low cross from Serge Aurier found Lamela just ahead of the penalty spot. His first shot was blocked but his second, a toe poke, was heading in until the intercession of Watford’s own debutant, winger Ignacio Pussetto. The substitute cleared the ball off the line with 10mm to spare and a share of the spoils was confirmed.", "Mourinho described goalline technology as “the technology that I like‚“ as he forswore making any remarks on VAR, despite an odd incident that could have led to Étienne Capoue being in trouble for a foul on Lo Celso, only for the batteries in Michael Oliver’s headset to run out at an inappropriate moment.

Bournemouth looked like perfect opponents to kickstart the home side’s campaign given Howe’s visitors had lost seven of their previous nine matches before this. Howe also made four changes to the side which lost at Brighton on Saturday with Callum Wilson leading the line despite enduring a run of 12 matches without a league goal.", "Moyes, who admitted this week that he had not been able to stop smiling since his reappointment, emerged just before kick-off to a decent reception from the home supporters and spent almost the entire first half prowling the technical area, clearly enjoying being back in his natural habitat.", "After a slow start, the 56-year-old’s enthusiasm was rewarded in the 17th minute when Robert Snodgrass’s cut back found Noble in acres of space and the captain’s shot from distance took a massive deflection off Lewis Cook to totally wrongfoot Aaron Ramsdale in the Bournemouth goal.", "Taking the lead – albeit through a huge slice of good fortune – seemed to immediately lighten the mood among the home supporters and it was not long until they were celebrating again. Haller, without a goal at the London Stadium since the defeat to Crystal Palace in October, has looked an increasingly dejected figure in recent weeks but the way he volleyed home a cross from Ryan Fredericks illustrated just why West Ham were prepared to pay £45m to sign him last summer.", "Noble’s second soon after from the penalty spot when Harry Wilson was somewhat harshly adjudged to have brought down the veteran midfielder almost lifted the roof off this vast arena.

Howe’s side briefly found themselves in third place back then but, like Haller at West Ham, the lack of goals for their main striker has coincided with their plunge down the table. They have not looked so vulnerable since the 2017-18 season, when they were in the bottom three at Christmas before a seven-game unbeaten run catapulted them up the table. On this evidence that kind of form looks beyond them but Howe will at least be encouraged by a better performance after the break after they switched to a back three.", "Asked if his players are suffering from a lack of confidence, he said: “I don’t think it takes a rocket scientist to see it’s damaged. It’s the first time we’ve been in the relegation zone for a long time but I almost think that is a good thing for us because it’s going to refocus energies. We need to change something.”", "Felipe Anderson rounded off a fine individual performance with the fourth goal following a wonderful cross field pass from Declan Rice with his left foot.

There was an air of inevitability that Danny Ings would play a key part here given the Crystal Palace manager spent much of the buildup to this match highlighting the striker’s predatory instincts inside the box. It was under Hodgson in Lithuania four years ago that the in-form Southampton striker won his sole England cap and here Ings, who turned his nose up at a move to Palace in favour of a return to his boyhood club last year, seized on a sloppy Martin Kelly pass to score his 12th goal of the season, cancelling out James Tomkins’s headed opener to earn a revived Southampton a point. Ings’s equaliser came just as things seemed to be getting away from them but in the end Palace, who had a first-half goal disallowed by VAR owing to a marginal offside decision, were grateful for a point.", "The Southampton substitute Moussa Djenepo assumed centre stage from Wilfried Zaha for the final half an hour and the winger would have snatched a winner but for a brilliant left-handed save by Vicente Guaita after Ings’s goal had galvanised the hosts. “The fact is that is what he does,” Hodgson said of Ings. “He is a goalscorer, he was alert to the misplaced back pass and then, of course, when he gets through to the goalkeeper you know he has the technique to score the goal. After the goal, they really took advantage of that Southampton. It gave them a lot of wind in their sails, they brought on fresh players to run at our defence and, to be honest, the last 15 minutes were a lot hairier than I’d have liked them to be, and maybe they needed to be.”", "Pantomime season is in full swing and Zaha relished the role of the villain but the opening stages were more slapstick than anything. Pierre-Emile Højbjerg patrolled the Southampton midfield with his back bare for a minute or two after tussles with Zaha and Luka Milivojevic left his shirt in tatters, flapping like a cape before a replacement was located. Zaha is Palace’s talisman and Southampton sought to stop him at source. When Djenepo entered, a panicking Palace backline were faced with a similar problem, with Guaita denying the winger before keeping out fine efforts by Ings and James Ward-Prowse, the latter from a free-kick.", "But poking and provoking Zaha supercharged Palace’s protagonist. Zaha fooled Cédric Soares at the byline, wringing the Southampton defender inside out before supplying a cross for Max Meyer to sweep home. Zaha roared at the Southampton support before joining the celebrations. They were short-lived, though, with Andy Madley indicating the video assistant referee was taking a closer look as Palace rejoiced on halfway. Replays showed it was a preposterously tight offside call by the VAR, Andre Marriner, and presumably one that had those at Stockley Park poring over every angle. Zaha’s left armpit was adjudged to be millimetres beyond Jack Stephens’s right armpit. “We didn’t have the VAR God on our side,” Hodgson said.", "That disallowed goal galvanised Southampton but rankled Palace, though it was forgotten five minutes after half-time when Nathan Redmond upended James McArthur and Tomkins glanced Milivojevic’s free-kick in off the crossbar. The deft delivery seemed to catch Southampton cold, as Tomkins breezed past a flat-footed Stephens to send a header beyond the former Palace goalkeeper, Alex McCarthy. Southampton had spurned chances, too, with Redmond cornering Mamadou Sakho before Jan Bednarek blazed over when left unmarked from a brilliant Ward-Prowse free-kick.", "Moments later Guaita spilled a Ward-Prowse corner and another mistake went unpunished but Palace were not quite so fortunate when Kelly gifted the ball to Ings 16 minutes from time. “The strange thing is that he is always the person in that situation,” Ralph Hasenhüttl, the Southampton manager, said. “It means he feels and smells where the opponent can get problems or into trouble.

Against West Ham it wasn’t.”", "Chelsea, who are six points above fifth-placed Wolves, did not let the nostalgia spilling from the stands blur their focus. They had to ignore the fuss over Terry’s return to Stamford Bridge and they were full of eager intensity eager after failing to commit a single foul against West Ham, taking their cue from N’Golo Kanté’s relentless energy in midfield. “They were good,” Dean Smith, Villa’s manager, said. “I thought there were three Kantés on the pitch.”", "Villa, a point above the bottom three, struggled to live with Chelsea’s speed. There were ominous signs as early as the fifth minute, when Christian Pulisic charged unopposed through the middle before teeing up Willian to sting Heaton’s palms, and the opening goal arrived when a lovely cross from James, a 19-year-old right-back with a wicked delivery, found Abraham unmarked in the area.", "Chelsea were far more dangerous with Abraham available after missing the West Ham game with a hip injury and the striker, who scored 26 goals during his loan spell at Villa last season, headed past Heaton after peeling away from Ezri Konsa. “Of course if a player’s on such a good run and they come out of the team it’s normal that you miss them,” Lampard said. “Today he came straight back in as he left off.”", "Yet frailties lingered at the other end.

Leicester had an excellent chance to go ahead when Héctor Bellerín made a mistake on his first league start of the season, playing a pass from the touchline straight to Vardy, and though the striker did the right thing in allowing the ball to run on to Ayoze Pérez the former Newcastle forward’s shot just cleared the bar. A Pérez cross from the right flashed across Arsenal’s goal with no one in a blue shirt able to get a touch moments later, before Youri Tielemans opted to blast a shot wastefully high after carving a swathe through midfield with the assistance of Maddison.", "Leicester kept getting closer as the first half progressed, and only the watchful presence of Calum Chambers at the far post prevented Vardy reaching the most inviting of low crosses from Pérez.

First Harvey Barnes made inroads down the left but crossed too high for Pérez to finish, then after Ricardo Pereira reached the byline on the right his perfectly placed cut-back gave Wilfred Ndidi almost too much time to finish. It looked as though the midfielder could hardly miss but he did not get over the ball well enough and a slightly casual sidefoot came back off the bar. Arsenal had the ball in the Leicester net shortly after that, just to show what an open game it had become, though the linesman flagged for offside when Aubameyang touched in Sead Kolasinac’s cross from the left and after an acceptably short delay – one that one would like to think was not prompted by the Arsenal fans chanting “VAR, VAR” – his decision was ratified by the remote technology.", "Pereira did well to cover back and pinch the ball from Aubameyang in the area after the Arsenal captain had eluded the central defenders once again to fasten on to another long ball from David Luiz at the back. The full-back was furious no offside flag had been produced but replays showed Aubameyang was onside and Pereira’s intervention had been necessary.", "The Leicester breakthrough came midway through the second half, when a subtle flick from Barnes found Tielemans in front of goal and he had the presence of mind to simply move the ball on to his left to an unmarked Vardy. Leicester’s leading scorer does not miss chances like that and Vardy duly stuck the ball beyond Bernd Leno, before turning provider seven minutes later after the impressive Pereira had made ground through the middle. The full-back’s accurate diagonal pass found Vardy, who turned the ball back for Maddison to beat Leno a second time with a shot through Bellerín’s legs.", "Once ahead, Leicester played out the remainder of the game with that brisk passing and pressing game they do so well, while Arsenal capitulated in the way they do so often.

No one appealed for it.”", "The Wolves manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, was more understanding. His grievance was with the amount of time it took for the decision to be reached but he suggested that may be a teething problem. “Everybody is going to speak about this game after game until things settle down and become normal,” he said. “We celebrate and then we don’t celebrate and then the Leicester fans celebrate a non-goal. It’s too much time. It is not the mindset of the game. But I think they are in the right way [but] they want to keep the game flowing.”", "His Leicester counterpart, Brendan Rodgers, said he approves of the new system and not just because it went in his team’s favour here. “The rule is pretty clear,” he said. “It was unfortunate for them and it benefited us, but my feeling is VAR is going to work for you some weeks and go against you in others. It’s frustrating if you score and then there’s a wait to be told it’s not a goal but I thought it was dealt with fairly well overall. It’s a part of the game now that everyone will have to make an adjustment and adapt to.”", "Dendoncker’s non-goal came after he and Boly outjumped Leicester’s defenders from a corner. An obvious conclusion was that would not have happened if Harry Maguire had not departed for Manchester United; his aerial power was a big factor in Leicester conceding fewer goals from set pieces than anyone else in the Premier League last season. The man tasked with replacing him here, 23-year-old Caglar Soyuncu, is not as dominant in the air. Other than that, however, Soyuncu did a fine job. Leicester’s main problem was, with Jamie Vardy shackled by defenders, they struggled to create clear openings despite having most of the ball. New season, familiar gripe.", "Wolves showed no ill-effects of the new challenge they face this season.

A nice theory, perhaps, but Wolves did not let the hosts put it into practice.", "Frequently Leicester became bogged down out of range of Wolves’ goal. It took a miscued volley by Maddison to catch the visiting defence off-guard in the first half, as the midfielder’s shot landed at the feet of Tielemans near the byline on the right. The Belgian fired the ball across the face of goal but Vardy did not react fast enough to turn it into the net from two yards. Too early in the season, perhaps.", "Wolves were dangerous on their infrequent counterattacks. Diogo Jota raced through on goal a few minutes after Dendoncker’s disallowed strike but dragged his shot wide of the far post.", "Leicester remained blunt. Harvey Barnes, a thrillingly anarchic runner at times, was sent on after the hour but did not threaten until stoppage time, when he swapped slick passes with Vardy before firing the ball into the danger zone.

Caught out for just a moment, Paulo Gazzaniga could not get close.", "It was Juan Foyth who lost the ball for Spurs, sauntering out from the back, and by the time the game restarted after half-time he had departed the field. Jan Vertonghen was hooked off too as José Mourinho abandoned an experiment with a back three and threw on every creative player he had. Within five minutes of the restart Spurs had parity; Jamal Lewis was deceived in an aerial duel with Kane, handled the ball to correct his mistake and gave away a free-kick in Eriksen territory, with the customary result.", "The madness was not over, however, and six minutes later Norwich were back ahead in comical circumstances. After a good spell of possession Emi Buendía released Pukki into the Spurs box. Just as the Finn was teeing up a shot, Alderweireld arrived on the scene and poked the ball off Pukki’s toe. What the Spurs man did not envisage, however, was Serge Aurier also turning up. The clearance bounced off the Frenchman and into the Tottenham net.", "At this point Spurs’ creative players grabbed hold of the match – with Tanguy Ndombele as midfield pivot the pick of the bunch. Norwich were under severe pressure but looked to be standing firm, central defenders Christoph Zimmermann and Grant Hanley regularly putting their bodies on the line.", "Then with nine minutes remaining Norwich lost possession in their attacking third. They then compounded the error by backing off a counterattack comprised of just Kane and Dele Alli and when Kane invited Zimmermann to jump in with a challenge in the box, the German obliged. Kane got up and did with his penalty what Eriksen had done with his free-kick.", "“It was not necessary to tackle in this moment,” said Farke, discussing yet another costly error for his team with Crystal Palace the next to visit Carrow Road on Wednesday. “We have to learn out of these moments and yes, it probably cost us two points. It was difficult for my two centre-halves but they showed great attitude and great commitment. If we go on with this great spirit and great commitment we still have a chance.”"], "datePublished": "Sat 28 Dec 2019 19.36 GMT"}}
